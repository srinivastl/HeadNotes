The  appellant\\u2019s  case\\nwas  on  July 22, 1948, referred by the  Central  Government\\nunder  S. 5(1) of the Act to the  Investigation  Commission.\\nfor  investigation and report.  The Commission directed  the\\nauthorised  official  under s. 6 of the Act to  examine  the\\nappellant\\u2019s accounts.  He submitted his final report by  the\\nend of 1953.  The Commission considered the report heard the\\nassessee  and came to the conclusion that Rs.  4,47,915  had\\nescaped  assessment.   Thereupon the appellant  on  May  20,\\nunder s. 8A of the Act, agreeing to pay Rs. 3,50,000 by  way\\nof tax and penalty at the concessional rate.  The Commission\\nreported   to  the  Central  Government  approving  of   the\\nsettlement,  the Central Government accepted it and  it  was\\nrecorded by the Commission.  The Central Government directed\\nthe  recovery of the said amount under s. 8A(2) of the  Act.\\nThe  appellant  was permitted to make  payments  by  monthly\\ninstalments  of Rs. 5,000 and the total amount thus paid  up\\nto  September 8, 1957, aggregated to Rs. 1,28,000.   In  the\\nmeantime  the  Income Tax Officer issued a  certificate  and\\ncertain properties of the appellant were attached.   Relying\\non  the decisions of this Court in Suraj Mall Mohta and  Co.\\nv.  A. V. Visvanatha Sastri, [1955] 1 S.C.R. 448 and M.  Ct.\\nMuthiah v. The Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras, [1955]  2\\nS.C.R.  1247, the appellant applied to the  Commissioner  of\\nIncome-tax  challenging the validity of the settlement  made\\nunder s. 8A of the Act on the ground that S. 5(1) Of the Act\\non  which  it  was founded had been declared  void  by  this\\nCourt,  and  claimed that his properties might  be  released\\nfrom  attachment  and the amount paid under  the  settlement\\nmight  be  refunded  to  him.,  On  January  29,  1958,  the\\nCommissioner  of  Income Tax sent a reply to  the  appellant\\nmaintaining that the settlement was valid and\\n                    529\\nthat  the  appellant  was bound thereunder  to  pay  up  the\\narrears of instalments and requesting him to continue to pay\\nin  future.   Against this decision of the  Commissioner  of\\nIncome  Tax the. appellant came up to the Supreme  Court  by\\nspecial leave.  It was contended on behalf of the respondent\\nthat   the  Act  laid  down    two   distinct   and separate\\nprocedures,   one  for  investigation  and  the  other   for\\nsettlement and it was the former alone and not the D, latter\\nthat  was affected by the decisions of this Court. and  that\\nthe  appellant by voluntarily entering into  the  settlement\\nhad  waived his fundamental right founded on Art. 14 of  the\\nConstitution.\\nHeld (Per Curiam), that both the contentions must fail.\\nIt  was not correct to say that the Taxation of Income  (In-\\nvestigation  Commission) Act, 1947, laid down two  different\\nprocedures,  one for investigation and assessment  under  s.\\nthe Act and assessment in terms of such settlement and  that\\nwhile  the decision of this Court in M. Ct.  Muthiah v.  The\\nCommissioner of Incometax, Madras, declaring s. 5(1) of  the\\nAct  to be discriminatory and therefore void, affected  only\\nthe former procedure and not the latter.  The Act laid  down\\nbut  one  procedure  and  in  entertaining  a  proposal  for\\nsettlement  as  in the investigation itself  the  Commission\\nexercised the same jurisdiction, and powers and followed the\\none and the same procedure as laid down by ss. 5, 6 and 7 Of\\nthe  Act.  Since the settlement in the instant case  was  no\\nexception  to that rule, it was covered by the decision  and\\nmust be held to be violative of Art. 14 Of the Constitution.\\nM.   Ct. Muthiah v. The Commissioner of Income-tax,  Madras,\\n[1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247, applied.\\nThe observations made in the majority judgment of this Court\\nin Syed Qasim Razvi v.

J., and Kapur J.-There could be no waiver of the\\nfundamental right founded on Art. 14 Of the Constitution and\\nit  was  not correct to contend that the  appellant  had  by\\nentering into the settlement under s. 8A of the Act,  waived\\nhis  fundamental right under that Article.  Article  14  was\\nfounded  on a sound public policy recognised and valued  all\\nover  the civilised world, its language was the language  of\\ncommand  and it imposed an obligation on the State of  which\\nno  person could, by his act or conduct, relieve it.  As  it\\nwas  not strictly necessary for the disposal of  this  case,\\nthe  question whether any other fundamental right  could  be\\nwaived need not be considered in this connection.\\nLaxamanappa  Hanumantappa jamkhandi v.

The State, A.I.R. 1958 Punj. 294, distinguished and  held\\ninapplicable.\\nPer  Bhagwati  and gubba Rao, jj.-There could be  no  waiver\\n\\u2019.,not  only of the fundamental right enshrined in  Art.  14\\nbut  also of any other fundamental right guaranteed by  Part\\nIII   of  the  Constitution.   The  Constitution   made   no\\ndistinction  between  fundamental  rights  enacted  for  the\\nbenefit  of the individual and those enacted in  the  public\\ninterest  or on grounds of the public policy.  There  could,\\ntherefore,  be  no  justification  for  importing   American\\nnotions  or authority of decided cases to whittle  down  the\\ntranscendental  character  of  those  rights,  conceived  in\\npublic interest and subject only to such limitations as  the\\nConstitution had itself thought fit to impose.\\nArticle  13(2) was in terms a constitutional mandate to  the\\nState  in respect of all the fundamental rights  enacted  in\\nPart III of the Constitution and no citizen could by  waiver\\nof  any  one  of  them  relieve  the  State  of  the  solemn\\nobligation  that lay on it.  The view expressed by  Mahajan,\\nC.  J., in Behram Khurshed Pesikaka v. The State of  Bombay,\\n[1955]  1  S.C.R. 613, correctly laid down the  law  on  the\\npoint.  Since the arguments in the instant case had  covered\\nthe entire field of fundamental rights, there was no  reason\\nwhy the answer should be confined to Art. 14 alone.\\nBehram  Khurshed Pesikaka v. The State of Bombay,  [1955]  1\\nS.C.R.  613; State of Travancore-Cochin v. The  Bombay  Co.,\\nLtd., [1954] S.C.R. 1112 and The State of Bombay v. R. M. D.\\nChamarbaugwala, [1957] S.C.R. 874, referred to.\\nPer  S.  K. Das, J.-It seems clear that Art. 13  itself  re-\\ncognises  the  distinction between  absence  of  legislative\\npower  which  will  make  the law  made  by  an  incompetent\\nlegislature  wholly void, and exercise of legislative  power\\nin  contravention of a restriction or check on  such  power,\\nwhich  will  make  the  law  void  to  the  extent  of   the\\ninconsistency  or contravention; therefore the mere  use  of\\nthe  word \\\" void \\\" in Art. 13 does not necessarily  militate\\nagainst the application of the doctrine of waiver in respect\\nof the provisions contained in Part III of the Constitution.\\nBehram  Khurshed Pesikaka v. The State of Bombay,  [1955]  1\\nS.C.R. 613, considered.\\nBhikaji  Narain  Dhakyas  v. The State  of  Madhya  Pradesh,\\n[1955] 2 S.C.R. 589; M. Ct.  Muthiah v.

R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala, [1957] S.C.R. 874, referred\\nto.\\nThere was nothing in the two preambles to the Indian and the\\nAmerican  Constitutions  that  could make  the  doctrine  of\\nwaiver applicable to the one and not to the other; since the\\ndoctrine\\napplied  to  the constitutional rights  under  the  American\\nConstitution, there is no reason why it should not apply  to\\nthe fundamental rights under the Indian Constitution.\\nCase-law considered.\\nBut it must be made clear that there is no absolute rule, or\\none  formulated in the abstract, as to the applicability  of\\nthat  doctrine to fundamental rights and such  applicability\\nmust depend on (1) the nature of fundamental right to  which\\nit  is  sought to be applied and (2) the foundation  on  the\\nbasis  of which the plea is raised.  The true test  must  be\\nwhether the fundamental right is one primarily meant for the\\nbenefit  of  individuals or for the benefit of  the  general\\npublic.\\nWhere,  therefore, the Constitution vested the right in  the\\nindividual,  primarily  intending to benefit  him  and  such\\nright  did not impinge on the rights of others, there  could\\nbe  a waiver of such right provided it was not forbidden  by\\nlaw or did not contravene public policy or public morals.\\nAs  in the instant case the respondents who had  raised  the\\nplea,  had failed to prove the necessary facts on  which  it\\ncould be sustained, the plea of waiver must fail.\\nPer  Subba  Rao, J.-Apart from the question  as  to  whether\\nthere  could be a waiver in respect of a fundamental  right,\\ns. 5(1) of the Taxation of Income (Investigation Commission)\\nAct, 1947, having been declared void by this Court in M. Ct.\\nMuthiah v. The Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras, as  being\\nviolative of the fundamental right founded on Art\\u2019 14 Of the\\nConstitution  and such decision being binding on all  courts\\nin India, the Commissioner of Income-tax had no jurisdiction\\nto continue the proceedings against the appellant under that\\nAct  and  the appellant could not by a waiver of  his  right\\nconfer jurisdiction on him.\\nNo  distinction could be made under Art. 13(1) of  the  Con-\\nstitution  between  the  constitutional  incompetency  of  a\\nlegislature  and  constitutional limitation  placed  on  its\\npower of legislation, for a statute declared void on  either\\nground would continue to be so, so long as the inconsistency\\ncontinued.  As the inconsistency of S. 5(1) of the Act  with\\nArt. 14 continued, it must continue to be void.\\nKeshavan Madhava Menon v. The State of Bombay, [1951] S.C.R.\\nS.C.R.  613  and Bhikaji Narain Dhakras v. State  of  Madhya\\nPradesh, [1955] 2 S.C.R. 589, referred to.\",\n          \"In pursuance of a search - warrant issued under s. 6 of  the\\nTaxation  on  Income (Investigation  Commission)  Act,  1947\\nauthorising  four  Officials  to  search  two  premises   in\\nCalcutta,  they  went  there and  forcibly  broke  open  the\\nentrance door of a flat in one case and the lock of the door\\nof  a  room in the other case.  On being challenged  by  the\\ndarwan  and the proprietor of the respective  premises  they\\nwere  alleged to have tied the darwan with a  rope,  causing\\nhim   injuries   and  to  have  assaulted   the   proprietor\\nmercilessly with the help of two policemen and kept him in a\\nlock up for some hours.  Two separate complaints-one by  the\\ndarwan  and the other by the proprietor-under ss. 323,  342,\\netc.,  of the Indian Penal Code were instituted  before  two\\ndifferent    Magistrates.    The   common    question    for\\ndetermination  in both the complaints was whether under  the\\ncircumstances  sanction  was necessary under s. 197  of  the\\nCode of Criminal Procedure.\\nHeld that sanction was necessary as the assault and the  use\\nof criminal force related to the performance of the official\\nduties  of the accused within the meaning of s. 197  of  the\\nCode of Criminal Procedure.\\n Art.  14  does not render s. 197 of the  Code  of  Criminal\\nProcedure  ultra vires as the discrimination on the part  of\\nthe Government to grant sanction against one public  servant\\nand   not   against   another  is  based   on   a   rational\\nclassification.\\nA  discretionary power is not necessarily  a  discriminatory\\npower  and abuse of power is not easily to be assumed  where\\nthe  discretion  is vested in the Government and  not  in  a\\nminor official.\\nIn the matter of grant of sanction under s. 197 of the  Code\\nof  Criminal  Procedure, the offence alleged  to  have  been\\ncommitted by the accused must have something to do, or  must\\nbe  related  in some manner with the discharge  of  official\\nduty.  In other words there must be a reasonable  connection\\nbetween the act and the discharge of official duty; the  act\\nmust bear such relation to the duty that the\\naccused could lay a reasonable claim, but not a pretended or\\nfanciful  claim,  that  he  did it in  the  course  of  this\\nperformance of his duty.\\nThe  need for sanction under s. 197 of the Code of  Criminal\\nProcedure is not necessarily to be considered as soon as the\\ncomplaint   is  lodged  and  on  the   allegations   therein\\ncontained.   The  question  may arise at any  stage  of  the\\nproceedings.   The complaint may not disclose that  the  act\\nconstituting the offence was done or purported to be done in\\nthe  discharge  of  official duty;  but  facts  subsequently\\ncoming to light on a police or judicial inquiry, or even  in\\nthe  course  of the prosecution evidence at the  trial,  may\\nestablish ,the necessity for sanction.  Whether sanction  is\\nnecessary  or  not may have to be determined from  stage  to\\nstage.  The necessity may reveal itself in the course of the\\nprogress of the case.\\nWhere  a power is conferred or a duty imposed by statute  or\\notherwise,  and there is nothing said  expressly  inhibiting\\nthe exercise of the power or the performance of the duty  by\\nany  limitations or restrictions, it is reasonable  to  hold\\nthat it carries with it the power of doing all such acts  or\\nemploying  such means as are reasonably necessary  for  such\\nexecution, because it is a rule that when the law commands a\\nthing to be done, it authorises the performance of  whatever\\nmay be necessary for executing its command.\\nGill  and another v.

The  Chief\\nCashier  had  to  give security for the  work  of  the  cash\\ndepartment; the Assistant Cashiers were employed upon  being\\nintroduced  by  the Chief Cashier who guaranteed  each  such\\nemployee.  There was long standing practice in the Bank that\\nat the end of the day when the cash was locked up under  the\\nsupervision of the Chief Cashier, all the assistant cashiers\\nhad  to be present so that the cash could be checked  before\\nbeing  locked  up.  In spite of reminders  C,  an  Assistant\\nCashier, had been leaving the Bank without the permission of\\nthe Chief Cashier for some time before the cash was  checked\\nand locked up.  The Chief Cashier reported the matter to the\\nmanagement,  withdrew  his  guarantee in respect  of  C  and\\nstated that unless the services of C were dispensed with his\\nconduct  would affect the security of the  cash  department.\\nThe Bank terminated the services of C in accordance with the\\nprovisions  of  para.  522(1) of the  All  India  Industrial\\nTribunal  (Bank Disputes) Award, 1953, without  holding  any\\nenquiry  against  C. The Industrial Tribunal  to  which  the\\ndispute  was  referred  held that this was in  fact  and  in\\nreality a case of termination of services for misconduct and\\nthe  Bank ought to have followed the procedure laid down  in\\npara. 521 of the Bank Award for taking disciplinary  action,\\nthat the termination of service was illegal and improper and\\nthat  C was entitled to reinstatement with full  back  wages\\nand other benefits :\\nHeld,  that  the  services of  the  Assistant  Cashier  were\\nproperly terminated by the Bank.  There was no doubt that an\\nemployer could not dispense with the services of a permanent\\nemployee  by  mere  notice and  claim  that  the  industrial\\ntribunal   had   no  jurisdiction  to   inquire   into   the\\ncircumstances  of such termination.  Even in a case of  this\\nkind the requirement of bona fides was essential and if  the\\ntermination  of  service was a colourable  exercise  of  the\\npower  or  as  a result of victimisation  or  unfair  labour\\npractice the tribunal had jurisdiction to interfere.   Where\\nthe  termination  of service was  capricious,  arbitrary  or\\nunnecessarily   harsh  that  may  be  cogent   evidence   of\\nvictimisation  or  unfair labour practice.  In  the  present\\ncase the security of the\\nBank was involved and if the Bank decided that it would  not\\ngo  into  the squabble between the Chief Cashier and  C  and\\nwould  use para. 522(1) of the Bank Award to  terminate  the\\nservices  of C it could not be said the Bank was  exercising\\nits  power under para. 522(1) in a. colourable  manner.

Section 3 authorised the Central  Government\\nto   constitute  an  Income  Tax  Investigation   Commission\\n(hereinafter  called the Commission) and imposed on  it  the\\nfollowing duties:-\\n\\\" (a) to investigate and report to the Central Government on\\nall matters relating to taxation on income, with  particular\\nreference  to the extent to which the existing law  relating\\nto, and procedure for, the assessment and collection of such\\ntaxation is adequate to prevent the evasion thereof;\\n(b)  to  investigate  in accordance with the  provisions  of\\nthis Act any case or points in a case -referred to it  under\\nsection 5 and make a report thereon (including such  interim\\nreport  \\u2019 s as the Commission may think fit) to the  Central\\nGovernment in respect of all or any of the assessments  made\\nin relation to the case\\nbefore the date of its report or interim report, as the case\\nmay be.\\\"\\nWe  may skip over s. 4 which dealt with the  composition  of\\nthe  Commission.  Section 5, which is of importance  was  as\\nfollows:-\\n\\\" 5. (1) The Central Government may at any time\\u2019 before  the\\ninvestigation  and  report any case or points in a  case  in\\nwhich  the  Central Government has prima facie  reasons  for\\nbelieving  that a person has to a substantial extent  evaded\\npayment  of taxation on income, together with such  material\\nas  may be available in support of such belief, and  may  at\\nany  time  before the 30th day of June, 1948, apply  to  the\\nCommission  for  the withdrawal of any case or points  in  a\\ncase  thus referred, and if the Commission approves  of  the\\nwithdrawal, no further proceedings shall thereafter be taken\\nby or before the Commission in respect of the case or points\\nso withdrawn.\\n(2)  The  Commission  may,  after  examining  the   material\\nsubmitted  by the Central Government with reference  to  any\\ncase or points in a case and making such investigation as it\\nconsiders  necessary, report to the Central Government  that\\nin its opinion further investigation is not likely to reveal\\nany  substantial evasion of taxation on income and  on  such\\nreport  being made the investigation shall be deemed  to  be\\nclosed.\\n(3)  No reference made by the Central Government under  sub-\\nsection (1), at any time before the 30th day of June,  1948,\\nshall  be called in question, nor shall the  sufficiency  of\\nthe  material  on which such a reference has  been  made  be\\ninvestigated in any manner by any Court.\\n(4)  If  in  the course of investigation into  any  case  or\\npoints  in a case referred to it under sub-section (1),  the\\nCommission has reason to believe-\\n(a)that  some  person other than the person  whose  case  is\\nbeing investigated has evaded payment of taxation on income,\\nor\\n(b)  that some points other than those referred to\\nit  by  the Central Government in respect of any  case  also\\nrequire investigation,\\nit  may make a report to the Central Government stating  its\\nreasons for such belief and, on receipt of such report,  the\\nCentral Government shall, notwithstanding anything contained\\nin  sub-section (1), forthwith refer to the  Commission  for\\ninvestigation  the  case  of  such  other  person  or   such\\nadditional points as may be indicated in that report.\\\"\\nThe date \\\" 30th day of June, 1948 \\\" appearing in sub-ss. (1)\\nand  (3) was, by Act 49 of 1948, substituted by the words  \\\"\\npowers  conferred on the Commission and s. 7 prescribed  the\\nprocedure of the Comission.  It is not necessary to set  out\\nthe  various  powers  and the details of  the  procedure  in\\nextenso  and  it  will suffice to say that  they  have  been\\nconsidered  by  this Court and pronounced to  be  much  more\\ndrastic  and harsh than the powers to be exercised  and  the\\nprocedure  to  be  followed by the  income  tax  authorities\\nacting  under the provisions of the Indian Income  Tax  Act,\\n\\\"  8.  (1)  Save  as otherwise provided  in  this  Act,  the\\nmaterials  brought on record shall be considered by all  the\\nthree  members  of the Commission sitting together  and  the\\nreport  of  the Commission shall be in accordance  with  the\\nopinion of the majority.\\n(2)  After  considering the report, tile Central  Government\\nshall by order in writing direct that such proceedings as it\\nthinks fit under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922, the Excess\\nProfits  Tax  Act, 1940, or any other law,  shall  be  taken\\nagainst  the  person  to whose case the  report  relates  in\\nrespect  of  the income of any period commencing  after  the\\ngiven,  such proceedings may be taken \\u2019and  completed  under\\nthe   appropriate  law  notwithstanding   the   restrictions\\ncontained in   section  34  of the Indian  Income  Tax  Act,\\nany  other law and notwithstanding any lapse of time or  any\\ndecision to a different effect given\\nin  the  case  by any Income tax  authority  or  Income  Tax\\nAppellate Tribunal.\\n(3).........................................................\\n(4)  In all assessment or re-assessment proceedings taken in\\npursuance  of  a  direction  under  sub-section\\u2019  (2),   the\\nfindings  recorded by the Commission on the case or  on  the\\npoints  referred to it shall, subject to the  provisions  of\\nsub-sections (5) and (6), be final; but no proceedings taken\\nin  pursuance  of  such  direction shall be  a  bar  to  the\\ninitiation  of  proceedings under section 34 of  the  Indian\\nIncome Tax Act, 1922.\\n(5).........................................................\\n(6).........................................................\\n(7)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  contained  in\\nthis  Act or in any other law, for the time being in  force,\\nany  evidence in the case admitted before the Commission  or\\nan  authorised official shall be admissible in  evidence  in\\nany proceedings directed to be taken under sub-section (2).\\n(8).........................................................\\nSection  9  barred  the jurisdiction of Courts  to  call  in\\nquestion  any  act or proceeding of the  Commission  or  any\\nauthorised  official appointed under s. 6. Section  10  gave\\npower   to   the  Central  Government  to  make   rules   by\\nnotification in the official gazette.\\nOn  July 22, 1948, the case of the assessee was referred  to\\nthe  Commission in the following terms:\\n\\\" Ministry of Finance (Revenue Division)\\n   New Delhi, the 22nd July, 1948.\\nUnder section 5 (1) of the Taxation on Income (Investigation\\nCommission)  Act, 1947, the cases of the  following  persons\\nare  hereby  referred to the  Investigation  Commission  for\\ninvestigation  and  report, as the  Central  Government  has\\nprima facie reasons for believing that each such person  has\\neither  alone  or  in combination  with  the  other  persons\\nmentioned  below, evaded payment of taxation on income to  a\\nsubstantial\\nextent.

It  also\\nappears that from January 8, 1949, to October 14, 1949,  the\\nauthorised  official  was  engaged  in  the  collection   of\\nassessment  records  of the assessee  from  the  territorial\\nincome tax offices and of materials from the Civil  Supplies\\nDirectorate  regarding the assessee.  In the meantime by  a.\\nthe Act as s. 8A:-\\n\\\" 8A.  Settlement of cases under investigation:(1) Where any\\nPerson  concerned in any case referred to or pending  before\\nthe  Commission for investigation applies to the  Commission\\nat  any time during such investigation to have the  case  or\\nany part thereof settled in so far as it relates to him, the\\nCommission shall, if it is of opinion that the terms of  the\\nsettlement  contained  in the application may  be  approved,\\nrefer  the  matter  to the Central Government,  and  if  the\\nCentral Government accepts the terms of such settlement, the\\nCommission  shall  have  the  terms  thereof  recorded   and\\nthereupon  the  investigation, in so far as  it  relates  to\\nmatters  covered by such settlement, shall be deemed  to  be\\nclosed.\\n(2)  For  the  purpose  of  enforcing  the  terms  of   any,\\nsettlement arrived at in pursuance of sub-section (1),\\n                    537\\nthe  Central Government may direct that such proceedings  as\\nmay be appropriate under the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 (XI\\nof 1922), the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 (XV of 1940),  or\\nany  other law may be taken against the person to  whom  the\\nsettlement relates, and in particular the provisions of  the\\nsecond  proviso to clause (a) of-sub-section (5) of  section\\napplicable  to  the recovery of any sum  specified  in  such\\nsettlement by the, Income Tax Officer having jurisdiction to\\nassess the person by whom such sum is payable as if it  were\\nincome-tax or an arrear of income-tax within the meaning  of\\nthose provisions.\\n(3)  Subject to the provisions of sub-section (6) of section\\nconclusive  as to the matters stated therein, and no  person\\nwhose case has been so settled be entitled to re-open in any\\nproceeding for the recovery of any sum under this section or\\nin  any  subsequent assessment  or  reassessment  proceeding\\nrelating  to taxation on income or in any  other  proceeding\\nbefore  any Court or other authority any matter which  forms\\npart of such settlement.\\n(4)  Where  a  settlement has been  accepted  by  Government\\nunder  sub-section (1), no proceedings under section  34  of\\nthe  Indian  Income  Tax Act, 1922 (XI of  1922),  or  under\\nsection 15 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 (XV of 1940),\\nshall be initiated in respect of the items of income covered\\nby the settlement, unless the initiation of such proceedings\\nis expressly allowed by the terms of the settlement.\\\"\\nOn  July  5, 1949, the total wealth statement  was  received\\nback  from the authorised official.  Our  Constitution  came\\ninto force on January 26, 1950.  The order-sheet shows  that\\nthe authorised official on May 26, 1950, issued a notice  to\\nthe  assessee  fixing the hearing for June 10,  1950,  which\\nindicates  that the authorised official was proceeding  with\\nthe  investigation  set in motion by the  reference  of  the\\nassessee\\u2019s\\ncase  to  the  Commission.  The  assessee  appears  to  have\\nattended on June 6, 1950, with an application for  extension\\nof time which apparently was given.  On September 30,  1950,\\nthe  assessee supplied certain statements of his firm.   The\\nentry  in  the order-sheet ,,,against the date  October  31,\\ntime.   There  appears to be a hiatus of about 3  years  and\\nevidently  nothing  was done until June 9,  1953,  when  the\\nauthorised  official fixed the hearing of the case  on  June\\nreport to the Commission on June 9. 1953.  The assessee  was\\nexamined  on October 9, 10 and 13, 1953, and the  authorised\\nofficial submitted his final report on October 19, 1953.  On\\nJanuary  30,  1954,  notice was issued to  the  assessee  to\\nappear   before  the  Commission  on  February   15,   1954.\\nPresumably  to  get ready for the hearing the  assessee,  on\\nFebruary 5, 1954, asked for inspection of certain assessment\\norders  concerning  his case-, for the return of  his  lease\\ndeed  filed  by him and a copy of the statement  of  one  L.\\nKalidas  and for production of certain documents before  the\\nCommission.  The hearing, which had been fixed for  February\\nwas  examined  on March 4,. 1954.  On March  29,  1954,  the\\nassessee  asked for a, copy of the deposition given  by  the\\nwitness Durgadas before the Commission.  After the  evidence\\nwas closed notice was issued to the assessee on May 1, 1954,\\nasking him to appear before the Commission on May 19,  1954.\\nOn that date the assessee attended, arguments were heard and\\norders  were  reserved.  Learned counsel  for  the  assessee\\nstates  that at the close of the arguments on May 19,  1954,\\nthe  Commission announced its view that the income,  profits\\nand  gains that had escaped assessment in the hands  of  the\\nassessee  for the period beginning with April 1,  1939,  and\\nending  March 31, 1947, were the sum of Rs.  4,47,915,  that\\nthe  Commission also threw a hint that should  the  assessee\\naccept the said finding he would be granted the benefit of a\\nsettlement  on the lower concessional basis of.  payment  of\\nother  alternative than to make the best of the bad  job  by\\nproposing  a  settlement  under s. 8A offering  to  pay  Rs.\\nis  amply borne out by paragraphs 3 and 4 of the  settlement\\napplication filed by the assessee on May 20, 1954, a copy of\\nwhich  has been produced before us by the respondents.   The\\nCommission on May 24, 1954, made a report under s. 8A (1) to\\nthe Central Government that it was of opinion that the terms\\nof   settlement  contained  in  the  application  might   be\\napproved.   The  Central  Government  having  accepted   the\\nproposed  settlement, the Commission had the  terms  thereof\\nrecorded.  The Central Government by its Order C No. 74  (9-\\nIT)  54  made  on  July 5, 1954, under  s.  8A  (2)  of  the\\nInvestigation Act directed that demand notice in  accordance\\nwith the said terms be served immediately by the Income  Tax\\nOfficer and that all such other proceedings under the Indian\\nIncome  Tax  Act or other law as may be necessary  be  taken\\nwith  a view to enforce the payment of the demand  and  that\\nthe  entire sum of Rs. 3,50,000 be demanded in one sum.   It\\nappears,  however,  that the assessee was  allowed  to  make\\npayments by instalments of Rs. 5,000, per month.\\nIn  the  meantime  on May 28,  1954,  this  Court  delivered\\njudgment  in  Suraj Mall Mohta and Co. v. A.  V.  Visvanatha\\nSastri (1).  In that case in the course of investigation  of\\nthe  case of Messrs.  Jute and Gunny Brokers Ltd. which  had\\nbeen  referred  to  the Commission under s.  5  (1)  of  the\\nInvestigation Act, it was alleged to have been discovered by\\nthe Commission that Suraj Mall Mohta and Co. had made  large\\nprofits  which  they had not disclosed and had  thus  evaded\\ntaxation.   A  report  to that effect having  been  made  on\\nAugust 28, 1953, by the Commission to the Central Government\\nunder  s.  5  (4)  of  the  Investigation  Act  the  Central\\nGovernment  on September 9, 1953, referred the case  against\\nSuraj  Mall  Mohta  and  Co. to  the  Commission  under  the\\nprovisions  of  s.  5  (4).   On  September  15,  1953,  the\\nCommission notified Suraj Mall\\n[1955]  1 S.C.R.448\\nMohta  and  Co.  that  their cases  had  been  referred  for\\ninvestigation  and  called  upon  them  to  furnish  certain\\nmaterials, details of which were set out in annexure to  the\\npetition.  On April 12, 1954, Suraj Mall Mohta and Co. filed\\na  petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution asking for  an\\nappropriate writ restraining the, Commission from taking any\\naction   on   the  ground  that  the   provisions   of   the\\nInvestigation  Act had become void being  discriminatory  in\\ncharacter.  By that judgment this Court held that both s. 34\\nof  the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922, as it then  stood,  and\\nsub-s.  (4)  of  s. 5 of the Investigation  Act  dealt  with\\npersons who had similar characteristics of being persons who\\nhad not truly disclosed their income and had evaded  payment\\nof tax on their income but that as the procedure  prescribed\\nby the Investigation Act was substantially more  prejudicial\\nthan  the procedure under the Indian Income Tax  Act,  1922,\\nsub-s.  (4)  of  s. 5 and the procedure  prescribed  by  the\\nInvestigation   Act,-in  so  far  as  it  affected   persons\\nproceeded  against  under that sub-section was  a  piece  of\\ndiscriminatory legislation which offended the provisions  of\\nArt.  14  of the Constitution and was, therefore,  void  and\\nunenforceable.\\nSub-section (4) of s. 5 of the Investigation Act having been\\ndeclared  void,  Parliament  passed the  Indian  Income  Tax\\nAmendment  Act  (33 of 1954) amending s. 34  of  the  Indian\\nIncome  Tax  Act,  1922.  Paradoxical as it  may  seem,  the\\nresult  of this amendment was that persons  who  originally,\\nfell only within the ambit of s. 5 (1) of the  Investigation\\nAct  and formed a distinct class of substantial tax  evaders\\nalso came within the amended s. 34 of the Indian Income  Tax\\nAct, 1922.  The position after the amendment, therefore, was\\nthat  the Income Tax Officers could pick out some  of  these\\npersons and refer their cases under s. 5 (1) of the Investi-\\ngation Act and thereby subject them to the drastic and harsh\\nprocedure  of  that Act, while they could  deal  with  other\\npersons  similarly situate under s. 34 as amended and  apply\\nto  them  the comparatively more beneficial  procedure  laid\\ndown  in the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922.  Promptly  several\\napplications were\\nmade  under  Art. 32 of the  Constitution  complaining  that\\nafter  the amendment of s. 34 of the Indian Income Tax  Act,\\ns.  5 (1) of the Investigation Act became discriminatory  in\\nthat the persons falling within it could be dealt with under\\nthe  drastic, prejudicial and harsh procedure prescribed  by\\nthe  Investigation  Act,  while    other   persons similarly\\nsituate and belonging to the same category could at the whim\\nor  pleasure  of  the Income Tax  authorities  be  proceeded\\nagainst under the more beneficial procedure prescribed under\\nthe  Indian  Income Tax Act.  All  those  applications  were\\ndisposed of by a common judgment reported as Shree Meenakshi\\nMills  Ltd.  v. Sri A. V. Visvanatha Sastri (1)  This  Court\\nheld  that  s. 34 of the Income Tax Act, as amended  by  the\\nIndian Income Tax Amendment Act, 1954 (33 of 1954), operated\\non the same field as s. 5 (1) of the Investigation Act, and,\\ntherefore, s. 5 (1) had become void and unenforceable as the\\nprocedure  applied to persons dealt with  thereunder  became\\ndiscriminatory  in  character.  It should be noted  that  in\\nnone of those petitions disposed of by that judgment had any\\nassessment  been made under the Investigation Act  and  this\\nCourt   only  prohibited  further  proceedings  before   the\\nCommission  under  the  Investigation  Act.   The   assessee\\nappellant  now before us who had entered into  a  settlement\\nunder s. 8 of the Investigation Act and had been assessed in\\naccordance with the terms of the settlement continued to pay\\nthe tax by monthly instalments of Rs. 5,000 as before.\\nFinally  on  December 20, 1955, came the  decision  of  this\\nCourt in M. CT.  Muthiah v. The Commissioner of Income  Tax,\\nMadras (2). In that case the Central Government had under s.\\nCommission.    The  Commission  after  holding  an   enquiry\\nrecorded its findings and held that an aggregate sum of  Rs.\\nperiod under investigation.  The Commission having submitted\\nits  report  to the Central Government,  the  latter  acting\\nunder  s.  8  (2) of the  Investigation  Act  directed  that\\nappropriate action under the\\n(1) [1955] 1 S. C. R. 787.\\n(2) [1955] 2 S. C. R. 1247.\\nIndian Income Tax Act, 1922, be taken against that  assessee\\nwith  a  view to assess or re-assess the  income  which  had\\nescaped  assessment for the period 1940-41 to 1948-49.   The\\nIncome  Tax Officer accordingly issued notices and made  the\\nre-assessment for the years 1940-41, 1941-42 and 1943-44  to\\ntreated  as final and conclusive.  These  assessment  orders\\nwere  served on that assessee.  There was, however,  no  re.\\nassessment  order  for the year 1942-43.  In regard  to  the\\nassessment  orders  which  had  been  served  the   assessee\\nconcerned applied to the Commissioner of Income Tax under S.\\nCourt on questions of law arising out of those re-assessment\\norders.   During  the  pendency  of  those  proceedings  the\\nassessee, in that case on December 6, 1954, filed a petition\\ncontending that the provisions of the Investigation Act were\\nillegal, ultra vires and unconstitutional.  The majority  of\\nthis Court held that different persons, though falling under\\nthe same class or category of substantial evaders of income.\\ntax,  were  being subjected to different procedures,  one  a\\nsummary  and  drastic  procedure and the  other  the  normal\\nprocedure  which gave to the assessees various rights  which\\nwere  denied to those who were specially treated  under  the\\n-procedure   prescribed  by  the  Investigation   Act   and,\\ntherefore, the assessments made under s. 8 (2) were void and\\nunenforceable.  That was a case of assessment under s. 8 (2)\\nin  invitum after an investigation under  the  Investigation\\nAct.   The assessee appellant before us, who had at the  end\\nof  the  investigation entered into a  settlement  and  been\\nassessed  in accordance with the terms of  such  settlement,\\nhowever, went on making payments in discharge of the balance\\ndue  under the terms of settlement right up to September  8,\\nthe aggregate payment up to Rs. 1,28,000.\\nIn   the  meantime  the  Income  Tax  Officer  had  sent   a\\ncertificate  requesting  the  Collector  of  Delhi  for  the\\nrecovery  of  the  balance due by  the  assessee  under  the\\nsettlement.  In execution of that certificate some of\\n                    543\\nthe   properties  belonging  to  the  assessee  situate   in\\nDharamsalla and Hissar were attached.  On December 27, 1957,\\nthe   assessee  made  an  application  to  the  Income   Tax\\nCommissioner.  After pointing out that between July 5, 1954,\\nand  December 27, 1957, the petitioner had paid in  all  Rs.\\nsettlement  and referring to the decisions of this Court  in\\nsuraj  Mall  Mohta\\u2019s  case (1) and Muthiah\\u2019s  case  (2)  the\\nassessee  submitted that the settlement under a. 8A  of  the\\nInvestigation Act had no force and did not bind the petitio-\\nner and that the settlement had been made under the pressure\\nof  the situation and in view of the coercive  machinery  of\\nthe Investigation Act and that from either point of view the\\nsettlement was not binding.  His contention was that when s.\\nthe  settlement under s. 8A could not be enforced,  for  the\\nfoundation of the proceedings under s. 8A was the  reference\\nunder  s. 5(1) and the foundation having crumbled  down  the\\nsuperstructure  must fall with it.  Under the  circumstances\\nthe  assessee  submitted  that the  attached  properties  be\\nreleased   and  the  amount  already  recovered  under   the\\nsettlement be refunded.  On January 29, 1958, the Income Tax\\nCommissioner   sent  the  following  communication  to   the\\nassessee:-\\nNo. L-228(1)/54-55/17590\\n Office  of  the Commissioner Income Tax  Delhi  and\\nRajasthan, New Delhi.\\n Dated,  New  Delhi the 29th  January,  1958.   Shri\\nBesheshar Nath,\\nNew Delhi.\\nDear Sir,\\nSub:-Taxation  on  Income  (Investigation  Commission)  Act,\\nWith  reference to your petition dated 27th December,  1957,\\nregarding the settlement arrived at\\n(1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 448.\\n(2) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247.\\nunder section 8A(2) of the Taxation on Income (Investigation\\nCommission)  Act,  1947,  I  am  to  inform  you  that   the\\nsettlement is valid and binding on you.\\ninstalments  which  you  have  not  paid  recently  by   5th\\nFebruary, 1958, and also to continue making the payments  in\\naccordance  with the instalments scheme agreed  to,  failing\\nwhich  the recovery proceedings will be  vigorously  pursued\\nthrough the usual recovery channels.\\n             Your\\u2019s faithfully,\\n             Sd./- S. K. Gupta,\\n         Commissioner of Income-tax,\\n        Delhi & Rajasthan, New Delhi.\\nBeing aggrieved by the above decision the assessee thereupon\\nmoved  this  Court  and obtained  special  leave  to  appeal\\nagainst  that order.  The appeal has now come up  for  final\\ndisposal before us.\\nIt may be mentioned here that as the respondents are anxious\\nto  have  the matters of controversy raised in  this  appeal\\ndecided  and  set at rest by a decision of this  Court,  the\\nrespondents,  for  the  purposes of this  appeal,  have  not\\ninsisted  on  their objection that an appeal  does  not  lie\\nunder  Art. 136 of the Constitution against an order of  the\\nCommissioner  of  Income  Tax.   Learned  counsel  for   the\\nassessee  also has not pressed his claim for refund  of  the\\namounts  already paid and has pressed the  appeal  regarding\\nthe  balance  that remains to be paid under  the  settlement\\nwhich   is   characterised  as  invalid.    Model   Knitting\\nIndustries  Ltd. which has a case pending in the High  Court\\nof Calcutta where the same questions as are in issue in  the\\nappeal  before us, are also in issue has been. permitted  to\\nintervene  and  we  have heard counsel  appearing  for  that\\nintervener.\\nIn  view  of the three decisions referred to  above  learned\\nAttorney General does not seriously contend that the  powers\\nconferred  on the Commission by s. 6 and the procedure  laid\\ndown   by   s.   7  of  the  Investigation   Act   are   not\\ndiscriminatory,  but what he urges is that none of the  said\\ndecisions has held that s. 5(1) is\\n                    545\\nwholly  void  and inoperative.  He says that  s.  5(1)  only\\nauthorises the Central Government to refer certain cases  to\\nthe  Commission.   Upon  such  a  reference  two  lines   of\\nprocedure  are clearly indicated by the  Investigation  Act,\\nnamely,  (1)  that an investigation may be held  in  invitum\\nfollowing the procedure prescribed and exercising the powers\\nconferred by the lnvestigation Act and (2) that a settlement\\nmay be made under s. 8A.  If the first procedure is followed\\nand an assessment is made under s. 8(2) such assessment will\\nundoubtedly  be invalid as has been held in  Muthiah\\u2019s  case\\n(1),  but  if  on  a  case  being  referred  the  settlement\\nprocedure  is  followed  then  the  consequential  order  of\\nassessment under s. 8A cannot be questioned.  We are  unable\\nto  accept this line of argument as permissible in  view  of\\nthe  provisions  of  the  Investigation  Act.   It  will  be\\nrecalled that when the case of the assessee was referred  to\\nthe Commission under s. 5(1) on July 22, 1948, there was  no\\nprovision for settlement in the Act at all.  Therefore, that\\nreference,  when it was made, consigned the assessee to  the\\nonly procedure of investigation that was then prescribed  by\\nthe  Act.   In the next place it should be  remembered  that\\nafter  s. 8A was added in the Investigation Act by s. 33  of\\nAct 67 of 1949 an authorised official was appointed under s.\\nexamine  the books and to interrogate any person  or  obtain\\nany  statement  from  any person and under  sub-s.  (4)  the\\nauthorised  official  was  empowered to  exercise  the  same\\npowers  as had been vested in the Commission  under  sub-ss.\\n(1) and (2) of s. 6. Further, by its own terms s. 8A made it\\nclear that the person concerned in any case referred to  the\\nCommission  for investigation might apply to the  Commission\\nat  any  time  during such investigation to  have  the  case\\nsettled.   Therefore  this provision for settlement  was  an\\nintegral part of the entire investigation procedure.  It was\\nnot  a  separate  or independent procedure  apart  from  the\\ninvestigation procedure.  It is true that there was  nothing\\nto prevent the assessee from straightaway\\n(1)  [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247.\\nmaking  a  proposal for settlement before  any  actual  step\\ntowards   investigation  -was  taken  by  the   Income   Tax\\nauthorities,  but  before  the Commission  could  refer  the\\nproposal for settlement to the Central Government it had  to\\nbe  satisfied that the terms of settlement contained in  the\\napplication were such as might be approved.  For the purpose\\nof satisfying itself the Commission had obviously to go into\\nthe facts either by itself or through an authorised official\\nand  to consider the materials collected by  the  authorised\\nofficial  and  in  the process of doing so had  to  hold  an\\ninvestigation of some sort and that investigation had neces-\\nsarily   to  be  made  in  accordance  with  the   procedure\\nprescribed   by  the  Investigation  Act  itself.   It   is,\\ntherefore,  not  correct to say that there could be  a  pro-\\nceeding for settlement without any investigation at all.  In\\nour  opinion s. 8A did not provide for a separate  procedure\\nat  all.   When  a case was referred under s.  5(1)  it  was\\nreally  for  investigation and a  settlement  was  something\\nwhich  could  crop up in the process of  that  investigation\\njust  as in the course of a suit parties may arrive at  some\\ncompromise.   In  recording  the compromise  and  passing  a\\njudgment  in  accordance with the  compromise  thereof,  the\\ncourt  exercises  the same jurisdiction as it  exercises  in\\nentertaining and disposing of the suit itself.  Likewise  in\\nentertaining  a  proposal  for  settlement  the   Commission\\nexercised  its  jurisdiction of investigation  under  s.  5,\\nfollowed the procedure prescribed by s. 7 and exercised  all\\nits  powers  under s. 6. As already stated the  language  of\\ns.8A  itself  shows that a settlement can be  proposed  only\\nduring such investigation.  In our judgment, therefore,  the\\ncontention   of  the  learned  Attorney  General  that   the\\nInvestigation  Act  prescribed two procedures is  not  well-\\nfounded.\\nLearned   Attorney   General  then  points  out   that   the\\nInvestigation Act was a pre-Constitution Act and that before\\nthe commencement of the Constitution when there was no  such\\nthing  as a fundamental right, its provisions could  not  be\\nquestioned  however  discriminatory the procedure  may  have\\nbeen.    He  urges  that  after  the  commencement  of   the\\nConstitution the\\nassessee  has not been subjected to the  coercive  procedure\\nlaid   down  by  the  Investigation  Act,  but   voluntarily\\n-proposed  a  settlement which was accepted by  the  Central\\nGovernment on the recommendation of the Commission.  In that\\nsituation  he  was in the same position as Qasim  Razvi  had\\nbeen in and the observations to be found in the judgment  of\\nMukherjea,  J., who delivered the majority judgment in  Syed\\nQasim  Razvi  v. The State of Hyderabad (1) applied  to  the\\npresent  appeal.  We do not think it is necessary,  for  the\\npurpose  of  this appeal, to go minutely into the  facts  of\\nQasim   Razvi\\u2019s  case  (1)  with  reference  to  which   the\\nobservations  relied  on had been made, or  to  analyse  the\\ncorrectness of the reasoning adopted in that case, for  that\\ncan  only be done by a larger Bench.  We are  definitely  of\\nopinion, however, that the observations made in the majority\\njudgement  should not be extended but must be kept  strictly\\nconfined to the special facts of that case. In our judgement\\nthose observations have no \\u02dcapplication to the facts of  the\\npresent   appeal  before  us,  for  here  even   after   the\\ncommencement   of   the   Constitution,   the   process   of\\ninvestigation continued in that the authorised official went\\non   collecting   materials  by  following   the   procedure\\nprescribed  by s. 7 and exercising the powers  conferred  on\\nhim by s. 6 of the Investigation Act.\\nThe  last argument advanced by the learned Attorney  General\\nis  that  if  there  had been a  breach  of  the  assessee\\u2019s\\nfundamental  right  by subjecting him  to  a  discriminatory\\n-procedure laid down in the Investigation Act, the  asessee,\\nby voluntarily entering into a settlement, must be taken  to\\nhave  waived such breach and cannot now be permitted to  set\\nup  his fundamental right.  Immediately two questions  arise\\nfor  consideration, namely, (1) whether the  assessee  could\\nwaive  the breach of the fundamental right in  question  and\\n(2)  whether in the facts and circumstances of this case  he\\nhad actually done so.\\nRe. (1): In Behram Khurshed Pesikaka v. State of\\nBombay (2) there was a general discussion whether a\\n(1)  [1953] S.C.R. 589.\\n(2)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 613.\\nfundamental right could be waived.  At page 638  Venkatarama\\nAiyar, J., observed:-\\n\\\"  The  question is, what is the legal effect of  a  statute\\nbeing  declared unconstitutional.  The answer to it  depends\\non  two  considerations  firstly  does  the   constitutional\\nprohibition  which has been infringed affect the  competence\\nof  the  Legislature  to enact the law  or  does  it  merely\\noperate  as  a check on the exercise of a  power  which  is-\\nwithin  its  competence;  and secondly, if it  is  merely  a\\ncheck, whether it is enacted for the benefit of  individuals\\nor  whether  it is imposed for the benefit  of  the  general\\npublic  on  grounds  of public policy.  If  the  statute  is\\nbeyond  the competence of the Legislature, as  for  example,\\nwhen  a  State enacts a law which is  within  the  exclusive\\ncompetence of the Union, it would be a nullity.  That  would\\nalso  be  the position when a limitation is imposed  on  the\\nlegislative  power in the interests of the public,  as,  for\\ninstance, the provisions in Chapter XIII of the Constitution\\nrelating  to inter-State trade and commerce.  But  when  the\\nlaw  is  within the competence of the  Legislature  and  the\\nunconstitutionality  arises by reason of its  repugnancy  to\\nprovisions enacted for the benefit of individuals, it is not\\na   nullity   but   is  merely   unenforceable.    Such   an\\nunconstitutionality  can be waived and in that case the  law\\nbecomes  enforceable.   In America this  principle  is  well\\nsettled. (Vide Cooley on Constitutional Limitations,  Volume\\nat pages 28 and 29-30).\\\"\\nAfter  referring to three decisions of the American  Supreme\\nCourt  which are also now relied on by the learned  Attorney\\nGeneral, the learned Judge concluded as follows:-\\n\\\" The position must be the same under our Constitution  when\\na law contravenes a prescription intended for the benefit of\\nindividuals.   The rights guaranteed under Art. 19  (1)  (f)\\nare enacted for the benefit of owners of properties and when\\na law is found to infringe that provision, it is open to any\\nperson whose rights have been infringed to waive it and when\\nthere\\n                    549\\nis waiver there is no legal impediment to the enforcement of\\nthe  law.   It  would  be otherwise if  the  statute  was  a\\nnullity;  in  which  case  it  can  neither  be  waived  nor\\nenforced.   If then the law is merely unenforceable and  can\\ntake  effect when waived it cannot be treated as non and  as\\neffaced  out of the statute book.  It is scarcely  necessary\\nto  add  that  the question of waiver  is  relevant  to  the\\npresent  controversy  not as bearing on any  issue  of  fact\\narising  for determination in this case but as  showing  the\\nnature  of the right declared under Art. 19 (1) (f) and  the\\neffect in law of a statute contravening it.\\\"\\nWhen the case came up before the court on review Mahajan, C.\\nJ.,  with  the concurrence of Mukherjea,  Vivian  Bose,  and\\nGhulam Hassan, JJ., said at page 653:-\\n\\\" In our opinion, the doctrine of waiver enunciated by  some\\nAmerican  Judges  in construing  the  American  Constitution\\ncannot  be introduced in our Constitution without  a  fuller\\ndiscussion of the matter.  No inference in deciding the case\\nshould have been raised on the basis of such a theory.   The\\nlearned Attorney General when questioned about the  doctrine\\ndid  not  seem to be very enthusiastic  about  it.   Without\\nfinally  expressing an opinion on this question we  are  not\\nfor the moment convinced that this theory has any  relevancy\\nin  construing the fundamental rights conferred by Part  III\\nof our Constitution.  We think that the rights described  as\\nfundamental  rights  are  a  necessary  consequence  of  the\\ndeclaration  in the preamble that the people of  India  have\\nsolemnly  resolved  to  constitute India  into  a  sovereign\\ndemocratic  republic  and  to secure  to  all  its  citizens\\njustice, social, economic and political; liberty of thought,\\nexpression belief, faith and worship; equality of status and\\nof opportunity.  These fundamental rights have not been  put\\nin  the Constitution merely for individual  benefit,  though\\nultimately   they   come  into  operation   in   considering\\nindividual rights.  They have been put there as a matter  of\\npublic  policy  and  the  doctrine of  waiver  can  have  no\\napplication to provisions of law which have been enacted  as\\na matter of constitutional policy.\\nReference to some of the Articles, inter alia, Arts. 15 (1),\\nget   discrimination  by  telling  the  State  \\\"   You   can\\ndiscriminate  \\\", or get convicted by waiving the  protection\\ngiven under Arts. 20 and 21.\\\"\\nOn  that  occasion one of us preferred not  to  express  any\\nopinion on this subject and said at page 670:-\\n\\\" In coming to the conclusion that I have, I have in a large\\nmeasure  found  myself  in  agreement  with  the  views   of\\nVenkatarama Aiyar, J., on that part of the case. 1, however,\\ndesire  to  guard myself against being understood  to  agree\\nwith  the  rest  of  the observations to  be  found  in  his\\njudgment,   particularly   those  relating  to   waiver   of\\nunconstitutionality,  the  fundamental rights being  a  mere\\ncheck on legislative power or the effect of the  declaration\\nunder Art. 13(1) being \\\" relatively void \\\". On those  topics\\nI prefer to express no opinion on this occasion.\\\"\\nIt  will, however, be noticed that the observations  of  the\\nlearned  judges  made  in that case did not  relate  to  the\\nwaiver of a breach of the fundamental right under Art. 14.\\nThe  fundamental right, the breach whereof is complained  of\\nby the assessee, is founded on Art. 14 of the  Constitution.\\nThe problem, therefore, before us is whether a breach of the\\nfundamental  right flowing from Art. 14 can be waived.   For\\ndisposing  Of  this  appeal it is not necessary  for  us  to\\nconsider  whether  any  of  the  other  fundamental   rights\\nenshrined  in Part III of our Constitution can or cannot  be\\nwaived.   We take the view that this court should  not  make\\nany  pronouncement  on any question which  is  not  strictly\\nnecessary for the disposal of the particular case before it.\\nWe, therefore, confine our attention to Art. 14 and  proceed\\nto discuss the question on that footing.\\n   Article 14 runs as follows:-\\n\\\"   The State shall not deny to any person  equality  before\\nthe  law  or  the equal protection of the  laws  within  the\\nterritory of India.\\\"\\nIt is the first of the five Articles grouped together  under\\nthe heading \\\" Right to Equality\\\". - The underlying object of\\nthis Article is undoubtedly to secure to\\n                    551\\nall persons, citizen or non-citizens, the equality of status\\nand  of oppotunity referred to in the glorious  preamble  of\\nour  Constitution.  It combines the English doctrine of  the\\nrule  of law and the equal protection T. clause of the  14th\\nAmendment to the American Federal Constitution which enjoins\\nthat   no  State  shall  deny  to  any  person  within   its\\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws \\\". There  can,\\ntherefore,  be  no  doubt or dispute that  this  Article  is\\nfounded  on a sound public policy recognised and  valued  in\\nall  civilised States.  Coming then to the language  of  the\\nArticle it must be noted, first and foremost that this Arti-\\ncle  is, in form, an admonition addressed to the  State  and\\ndoes not directly purport to confer any right on any  person\\nas  some  of  the other Articles, e.g.,  Art.  19,  do.  The\\nobligation  thus imposed on the State, no doubt, enures  for\\nthe  benefit of all persons, for, as a necessary  result  of\\nthe  operation  of  this Article, they  all  enjoy  equality\\nbefore  the  law.  That is, however,  the  indirect,  though\\nnecessary  and  inevitable,  result  of  the  mandate.   The\\ncommand  of  the Article is directed to the  State  and  the\\nreality  of the obligation thus imposed on the State is  the\\nmeasure  of the fundamental right which every person  within\\nthe  territory  of  India is to enjoy.  The  next  thing  to\\nnotice is that the benefit of this Article is not limited to\\ncitizens,  but  is  available  to  any  person  within   the\\nterritory of India.  In the third place it is to be observed\\nthat, by virtue of Art. 12, \\\" the State \\\" which is, by  Art.\\nGovernment  and Parliament of India and the  Government  and\\nthe legislature of each of the States and all local or other\\nauthorities  within  the  territory of India  or  under  the\\ncontrol of the Government of India.  Article 14,  therefore,\\nis  an  injunction to both the legislative as  well  as  the\\nexecutive  organs  of the State and  the  other  subordinate\\nauthorities.  As regards the legislative organ of the State,\\nthe fundamental right is further consolidated and  protected\\nby  the provisions of Art. 13.  Clause (1) of  that  Article\\nprovides that all laws in force in the territories of  India\\nimmediately before the commencement of the Constitution,  in\\nso\\nfar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part III\\nshall, to the extent of the inconsistency be void.  Likewise\\nel. (2) of this Article prohibits the State from making  any\\nlaw which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by the\\nsame  Part and follows it up by saying that any law made  in\\ncontravention  of  this clause Shall, to the extent  of  the\\ncontravention, be void.  It will be observed that- so far as\\nthis  Article  is concerned, there is no relaxation  of  the\\nrestriction  imposed by it such as there are in some of  the\\nother  Articles, e.g., Art. 19, cls. (2) to (6).  Our  right\\nto  equality before the law is thus completely  and  without\\nany  exception secured from all legislative  discrimination.\\nIt  is  not  necessary, for the purpose of  this  appeal  to\\nconsider  whether an executive order is a \\\" law\\\" within  the\\nmeaning of Art. 13, for even without the aid of Art. 13  our\\nright  to  the  equal protection of  the  law  is  protected\\nagainst  the vagaries, if any, of the  executive  Government\\nalso.  In this connection the observations of Lord Atkin  in\\nEshugbayi  Eleko v. Officer Administering the Government  of\\nNigeria  (1)  are apposite.  Said his Lordship at  page  670\\nthat  in accordance with British jurisprudence no member  of\\nthe executive can interfere with the liberty or property  of\\na British subject except when be can support the legality of\\nhis  act  before  a court of justice That  apart,  the  very\\nlanguage  of Art. 14 of the Constitution  expressly  directs\\nthat \\\" the State \\\", which by Art. 12 includes the  executive\\norgan, shall not deny to any person equality before the  law\\nor  the equal protection of the law.  Thus Art. 14  protects\\nus  from  both legislative and executive tyranny by  way  of\\ndiscrimination.\\nSuch  being  the  true  intent and effect  of  Art.  14  the\\nquestion  arises, can a breach of the obligation imposed  on\\nthe  State be waived by any person ? In the face of such  an\\nunequivocal  admonition  administered by  the  Constitution,\\nwhich  is  the supreme law of the land, is it  open  to  the\\nState  to disobey the constitutional mandate merely  because\\n\\u2019a  person  tells  the  State that it may do  so  ?  If  the\\nConstitution asks the State as\\n(1)  L.R. [1931] A,.C. 662.\\nto  why the State did not carry out its behest, will  it  be\\nany  answer for the State to make that \\\" true, you  directed\\nme not to deny any person equality before the law, but  this\\nperson  said that I could do so, for he had no objection  to\\nmy doing it.\\\" I do not think the State will be in any better\\nposition than the positions in which Adam found himself when\\nGod asked him as to why he had eaten the forbidden fruit and\\nthe  State\\u2019s above answer will be as futile as was  that  of\\nAdam  who pleaded that the woman had tempted him and  so  he\\nate  the forbidden fruit.  It seems to us absolutely  clear,\\non  the language of Art. 14 that it is a command  issued  by\\nthe  Constitution to the State as a matter of public  policy\\nwith a view to implement its object of ensuring the equality\\nof status and opportunity which every welfare State, such as\\nIndia,  is by her Constitution expected to do and no  person\\ncan, by any act or conduct, relieve the State of the  solemn\\nobligation  imposed on it by the Constitution.   What.  ever\\nbreach of other fundamental right a person or a citizen  may\\nor  may  not waive, he cannot certainly give up or  waive  a\\nbreach of the fundamental right that is indirectly conferred\\non him by this constitutional mandate directed to the State.\\nThe learned Attorney General has relied on various  passages\\nin  text-books  written by well-known and  eminent  writers,\\ne.g.,  Cooley,  Willoughby, Willis and Rottschaefer  and  on\\neight American decisions.  In considering the statements  of\\nlaw  made  by  American writers  and  judges  the  following\\nobservations  of  Patanjali Sastri, C. J., in The  State  of\\nTravancore-Cocochin  and others v. The Bombay Co.  Ltd.  (1)\\nshould conatantly be borne in mind:-\\nscope and purpose, and a varying body of doctrines and tests\\nhave   grown   around  them   interpreting,   extending   or\\nrestricting,   from  time  to  time,  their  operation   and\\napplication  in  the  context  of  the  expanding   American\\ncommerce  and industry, and we are of opinion that not  much\\nhelp can be derived from them\\n(1)  [1952] S.C.R. 1112,112O, 1121.\\nin  the solution of the problems arising under Art.  286  of\\nthe Indian Constitution.\\\"\\n(See also The State of Bombay v. R.M.D.  Chamarbaugwala(1)).\\nThe  American  authorities  cited by  the  Attorney  General\\nrelate  to  waiver of obligations under a contract,  of  the\\ndeprivation of right to property without due process of  law\\nor  of  the constitutional right to trial by  jury  and  the\\nlike.  They have no bearing on the question of the waiver of\\nthe  equal  protection clause of the 14th  Amendment  which,\\nlike our Art. 14, is a mandate to the State.  It is signifi-\\ncant that no American decision is forthcoming which  upholds\\nthe  waiver  of the breach of that clause.  When a  case  of\\nbreach  of  any of the fundamental rights akin to  what  are\\ndealt  with in the American authorities will come before  us\\nit  will,  then,  be  the  time  for  us  to  discuss  those\\nauthorities  and  to  consider their  applicability  in  the\\nmatter of the interpretation of the corresponding provisions\\nof  our Constitution.  For the moment we prefer  to  confine\\nour observations to a consideration of waiver of the  breach\\nof the fundamental right under Art. 14.\\nLearned  Attorney General has relied on three  decisions  of\\nthis  Court:  (1) Laxmanappa Hanumantappa Jamkhandi  v.  The\\nUnion  of India (2), (2) Dewan Bahadur Seth Gopal Das  Mohta\\nv.  The Union of India (3) and (3) Baburao Narayanrao  Sanas\\nv.  The  Union of India(4) in support of his thesis  that  a\\nbreach  of Art. 14 may well be waived by a person.  In  none\\nof  those cases, all of which were disposed of on  the  same\\nday   (October  21,  1954)  was  the  question   of   waiver\\nspecifically  or  seriously discussed.  As  learned  counsel\\nappearing  for the intervener points out, the first  of  the\\nabove mentioned cases proceeded on the footing that as  Art.\\ncould  not be enforced under Art. 32.  Learned  counsel  for\\nthe  intervener further submitted that the decision  in  the\\nbasis and on -the further ground that proceeding under  Art.\\n(1)  [1957] S.C.R. 874, 918.\\n(3)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 773.\\n(2)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 769\\n(4)  [1954] 26 I.T.R. 725.\\nintended  to  be  used  for  obtaining  relief  against  the\\nvoluntary action of a person and that appropriate remedy for\\nrecovery  of money lay in a suit.  The decision in  the  3rd\\ncase  proceeded  on  the same basis and did  not  carry  the\\nmatter any further.  It is impossible to treat any of  those\\ndecisions  as  representing the considered opinion  of  this\\nCourt  on  the  question  of  waiver  of  a  breath  of  the\\nfundamental  right  under  Art.  14  of  the   Constitution.\\nReference  was also made by the learned Attorney General  to\\nthe  decision of a Single Judge of the Allahabad High  Court\\nin  Subedar v. State (1) where it was held that  Art.  20(3)\\nconferred  merely a privilege and that such privilege  could\\nalways  be waived It was overlooked that if a person  volun-\\ntarily answered any question then there was no breach of his\\nfundamental right at all, for the fundamental right is  that\\na  person  shall not be compelled  to  incriminate  himself.\\nThat  case, therefore, is not a case of waiver at all.   The\\ncase of Pakhar Singh v. The State (2) is also, for the  same\\nreason, not a case of waiver.\\nBe.  (2):  The answer to this question  depends  upon  facts\\nwhich  have not been properly investingated.  The appeal  is\\nagainst the order of the income tax authorities which  order\\nmakes  no  reference  to the plea of  waiver.   Further  the\\nfiling of the statements of case having been dispensed with,\\nwe  have  not had the benefit of the statement of  facts  on\\nwhich  this plea is said to be founded.  The view  taken  on\\nquestion (1), however, relieves us of the necessity of going\\ninto this question.\\nOn  a consideration of the nature of the  fundamental  right\\nflowing from Art. 14, we have no doubt in our mind that  it-\\nis  not  for a citizen or any other person who  benefits  by\\nreason  of  its  provisons  to  waive  any  breach  of   the\\nobligation on the part of the State.  We are, therefore,  of\\nthe  opinion that this appeal should be accepted, the  order\\nof  the  Income Tax Commissioner, Delhi, dated  January  29,\\nfor  implementation  of the order of  the  Union  Government\\ndated July 5, 1954,\\n(1)  A. I. R. 1957 All. 396.\\n(2)  A. 1. R. 1958 Punj. 294.\\nshould  be quashed and that the assessee  appellant,  should\\nget the costs of this appeal.\\nBHAGWATI,  J.-I  agree with the reasoning  adopted  and  the\\nconclusion reached in the judgments prepared by My Lord  the\\nChief  Justice and my brother, S. K. Das, J., in  regard  to\\nthe  ultra vires character of the proceedings adopted  under\\ns. 8-A of the Taxation on Income (Investigation  Commission)\\nAct,  1947  (30  of 1947), and the  void  character  of  the\\nsettlement reached thereunder.  As regards the parts of  the\\njudgments which deal with the question whether a fundamental\\nright guaranteed by the Constitution can be waived at all, I\\nfind  myself in agreement with the judgment prepared  by  my\\nbrother, Subba Rao, J., and am of the opinion that it is not\\nopen to a citizen to waive the fundamental rights  conferred\\nby Part III of the Constitution.\\nThe  question of waiver came to be argued before us in  this\\nway.If the proceedings and the settlement under section  8-A\\nof the Act were void as aforesaid, the respondent  contended\\nthat   the  appellant  had  waived  the  fundamental   right\\nenshrined  in Art. 14 of the Constitution and was  therefore\\nnot entitled to challenge the settlement.  This was only  by\\nway of reply to the contention of the appellant and was  not\\nset  out in proper details in any affidavit filed on  behalf\\nof  the respondent.  The learned Attorney-General,  however,\\nrelied upon the application made by the appellant before the\\nInvestigation  Commission and the contents thereof  as  also\\nthe  payments made by the appellant from time to  time  both\\nbefore and after the pronouncement of our decision in M. Ct.\\nMuthiah  v.  The Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras  (1)  in\\norder  to  support  this plea of waiver  and  the  arguments\\nbefore  us proceeded on that basis.  No objection was  taken\\nby  either of the parties before us to the issue  of  waiver\\nbeing decided on such materials and the question was  argued\\nat  considerable length before us.  The  arguments  moreover\\nextended  to the whole field of fundamental rights and  were\\nnot confined to Art. 14 only.\\n(1)  [1955] 2 S. C. R. 1247.\\n                    557\\nWe,  therefore,  see no reason why we  should  refrain  from\\npronouncing our opinion on that question.\\nThe  preamble to our Constitution, Art. 13 and the  language\\nin  which the fundamental rights have been enacted  lead  to\\none conclusion and one conclusion only that whatever be  the\\nposition  in America, no distinction can be drawn  here,  as\\nhas been attempted in the United States of America,  between\\nthe  fundamental  rights  which may be  said  to  have  been\\nenacted for the benefit of the individual and those  enacted\\nin public interest or on grounds of public policy.  Ours  is\\na  nascent  democracy.  and situated as  we  are,  socially,\\neconomically,  educationally  and  politically,  it  is  the\\nsacred     duty  of  the  Supreme  Court  to   safeguard the\\nfundamental  rights  which  have been  for  the  first  time\\nenacted in Part III of our Constitution.  The limitations on\\nthose  rights have been enacted in the Constitution  itself,\\ne.g., in Arts. 19, 33 and 34.  But unless and until we  find\\nthe  limitations on such fundamental rights enacted  in  the\\nvery   provisions   of  the  Constitution,   there   is   no\\njustification  whatever for importing any notions  from  the\\nUnited  States of America or the authority of cases  decided\\nby  the  Supreme Court there in order to  whittle  down  the\\nplenitude of the fundamental rights enshrined in Part III of\\nour Constitution.\\nThe genesis of the declaration of fundamental rights in  our\\nConstitution can be traced to the following passage from the\\nReport of the Nehru Committee (1928):-\\n\\\" Canada, Australia and South Africa have no declaration  of\\nrights in their Constitutions but there are various articles\\nto  be  found in the Constitution of the  Irish  Free  State\\nwhich  may  properly  be grouped under the  general  head  \\\"\\nfundamental  rights  \\\". The reason for this is  not  far  to\\nseek.   Ireland  is the only country  where  the  conditions\\nobtaining  before  the treaty were the nearest  approach  to\\nthose we have in India.  The first concern of the people  of\\nIreland was, as indeed it is of the people of India  to-day,\\nto secure fundamental rights that have been denied to  them.\\nThe other dominions had their rise from earlier British\\nsettlements  which were supposed to have carried the law  of\\nEngland  with  them.  Ireland was taken and kept  under  the\\nrule of England against her own will and the acquisition  of\\ndominion status by her became a matter of treaty between the\\ntwo  nations.  We conceive that the constitutional  position\\nin India is very much the same.  That India is a  dependency\\nof  Great  Britain cannot be denied.  That position  can  be\\naltered  in one of two ways-force or mutual consent.  It  is\\nthe  latter  in furtherance of which we are called  upon  to\\nrecommend  the principles of a constitution for  India.   In\\ndoing so it is obvious that our first care should be to have\\nour fundamental rights guaranteed in a manner which will not\\npermit their withdrawal under any circumstances.\\\"\\nAt  the Round Table Conference that preceded the  making  of\\nthe  Government of India Act, 1935, therefore,  the,  Indian\\nleaders  pressed  for  a  Bill of  Rights  in  the  proposed\\nConstitution  Act, in order to bind the administration  with\\ncertain  declarations  of  individual  rights.   This   was,\\nhowever,  rejected  by  the  Simon  Commission  with   these\\nobservations:\\n\\\"  We are aware that such provisions have been  inserted  in\\nmany Constitutions, notably in those of the European  States\\nformed  after the War.  Experience, however, has  not  shown\\nthem   to  be  of  any  great  practical  value.    Abstract\\ndeclarations  are  useless unless there exist the  will  and\\nmeans to make them effective.\\\"\\nThe  framers  of  our  Constitution  however  followed   the\\nAmerican  view represented by the famous words of  Jefferson\\nin preference to that expressed by the Simon Commission :-\\n\\\"  The  inconveniences of the declaration are, that  it  may\\ncramp  government in its useful exertions.  But the evil  of\\nthis   is   short-lived,  moderate   and   reparable.    The\\ninconveniences  of the want of a declaration are  permanent,\\nafflictive   and   irreparable.   They   are   in   constant\\nprogression  from  bad  to  worse.   The  executive  in  our\\ngovernments  is not the sole, it is scarcely  the  principal\\nobject  of my jealousy.  The tyranny of the legislatures  is\\nthe most formidable dread...................\\n(Vide  Basu\\u2019s Commentary on the Constitution of India,  Vol.\\nand  incorporated the fundamental rights in Part III of  our\\nConstitution.\\nThe object sought to be achieved was as the preamble to  the\\nConstitution  states  \\\"  to secure  to  all  its  -citizens:\\nJUSTICE, social, economic and political; -]LIBERTY of status\\nand of opportunity; and to promote among them all FRATERNITY\\nassuring the dignity of the individual and the unity of  the\\nNation and Art. 13 provided:-\\n\\\"  13.

To\\nborrow the words of My Lord the Chief Justice \\\" In the  face\\nof   such   unequivocal  admonition  administered   by   the\\nConstitution,  which is the supreme law of the land,  is  it\\nopen  to  the State to disobey  the  Constitutional  mandate\\nmerely because a citizen told the State that it may do so  ?\\nif  the Constitution asks the State as to why the State  did\\nnot  carry  out its behest, will it be any  answer  for  the\\nState to make that \\\" True, you directed me not to take  away\\nor  abridge  the  rights conferred by this  Part,  but  this\\ncitizen said that I could do so, for he had no objection  to\\nmy doing so.\\\" I do not think the State will be in any better\\nposition than the position in which Ad-am found himself when\\nGod asked him as to why he had eaten the forbidden fruit and\\nthe  State\\u2019s above answer will be as futile as that of  Adam\\nwho pleaded that the woman had tempted him and Bo he ate the\\nforbidden  fruit.\\\"  It is absolutely clear on a  perusal  of\\nArt.  13(2) of the Constitution that it is a  constitutional\\nmandate\\nto  the  State  \\u2019and no citizen can by any  act  or  conduct\\nrelieve the State of the solemn obligation imposed on it  by\\nArt. 13(2) and no distinction can be made at all between the\\nfundamental rights enacted for the benefit of the individual\\nand  those enacted in the public interest or on  grounds  of\\npublic policy.\\nWhat  then  is the basis of this distinction  which  has  be\\nstrenuously   urged  before  us  that  there   are   certain\\nfundamental  rights which are enacted only for  the  private\\nbenefit of a citizen, e.g., rights of property, which can be\\nwaived by him and there are other fundamental rights enacted\\nfor the public good or as a matter of public policy which it\\nwould not be open to a citizen to waive even though he  were\\naffected by the breach thereof.  Reliance is placed in  this\\nbehalf  on  certain decisions of the Supreme  Court  of  the\\nUnited  States of America, passages from Willoughby,  Willis\\nand   Rottschaeffer,  quoted  in  the  judgment  of  T.

(Vide  pp.\\nbe  accepted.  There is nothing in the terms of the  various\\narticles embodying the fundamental rights in Part III of our\\nConstitution   which  warrants  such  a  distinction.    The\\nfundamental  rights  are  enacted  with  all  precision  and\\nwherever  limitations on their exercise are thought of  they\\nare also similarly enacted.  Such constitutional limitations\\nare to be found within the terms of the articles  themselves\\nand  there is no justification for reading in the  terms  of\\nthe  articles  anything more than what is  expressly  stated\\ntherein.   There  is further this  distinction  between  the\\nAmerican  Constitution  and ours that whereas  the  American\\nConstitution  was  merely enacted in order to  form  a  more\\nperfect   union,   establish   justice,   insure    domestic\\ntranquillity,  provide  for  common  defence,  promote   the\\ngeneral welfare and secure the blessings of liberty and  was\\nan outline of government and nothing more, our  Constitution\\nwas\\n(1)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 613.\\n   562\\nenacted  to  secure  to  all  citizens,  justice,  Liberty.\\u2019\\nEquality  and  Fraternity and laid emphasis on  the  welfare\\nstate and contained more detailed provisions,, defining  the\\nrights  and also laying down restrictions thereupon  in  the\\ninterest of the general welfare, etc. -As observed by  Wills\\nin his Constitutional Law at p. 477:-\\n\\\"The  conflict between man and the state is as old as  human\\nhistory.   For  this reason some compromise must  be  struck\\nbetween private liberty and public authority.  There is some\\nneed  of  protecting personal liberty  against  governmental\\npower  and  also some need of limiting personal  liberty  by\\ngovernmental  power.   The ideal situation is  a  matter  of\\nbalancing  one against the other, or  adjusting  conflicting\\ninterests.\\\"\\n\\\" In the United States Constitution an attempt has been made\\nto  strike  a proper balance between  personal  liberty  and\\nsocial control through express limitations written into  the\\nConstitution  and  interpreted  by  the  Supreme  Court,  by\\nimplied limitations created by the Supreme Court, and by the\\ndevelopment of the governmental powers of regulation,  taxa-\\ntion,  and eminent domain by the Supreme Court.\\\"  (Ibid  pp.\\nwhereas our Constitution has expressly sought to strike  the\\nbalance between a written guarantee of individual rights and\\nthe collective interests of the community by making  express\\nprovisions  in that behalf in Part III of the  Constitution.\\n(Vide Gopalan v.

R. M. D. Chamarbaugwala(1)\\nThe  rights conferred on citizens may be thus  classified  :\\n(i) statutory rights; (ii) constitutional rights; and  (iii)\\nfundamental  rights.   One need not consider  the  statutory\\nrights  in  this context but the constitutional  rights  are\\nthose  created and conferred by the Constitution.  They  may\\nor  may not be waived by a. citizen, as stated in  the  text\\nbooks  and the decisions of the Supreme Court of the  United\\nStates  of America above referred to.  But when  the  rights\\nconferred  are  put  on a high pedestal and  are  given  the\\nstatus  of fundamental rights, which though embodied in  the\\nConstitution itself are in express terms distinguished  from\\nthe  other constitutional rights (e.g.,  fundamental  rights\\nwhich are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution and  are\\nenacted as immune from any legislation inconsistent with  or\\nderogatory thereto and other constitutional rights which are\\nenacted  in other provisions, for instance in Arts. 265  and\\nabsolutely  inviolable  save  as expressly  enacted  in  the\\nConstitution  and  cannot  be  waived  by  a  citizen.   The\\nConstitution  adopted by our founding fathers is  sacrosanct\\nand  it is not permissible to tinker with those  fundamental\\nrights  by any ratiocination or analogy of the decisions  of\\nthe Supreme Court of the United States of America.  The only\\nmanner in which that can be done is by appropriate amendment\\nof the Constitution and in no other manner whatever.\\nThere is no difficulty whatever in working out this position\\nand to my mind the difficulties pointed out\\n(1)  [1957] S.C.R. 874, 918.\\nare more imaginary than real.  If a citizen wanted to assert\\nhis fundamental right under the circumstances envisaged  for\\ninstance  in the judgment of my brother S. K. Das,  J.,  and\\nmade an application for a writ under Art. 32 or Art. 226  of\\nthe  Constitution he would be promptly confronted  with  the\\nargument  that  the  Court should in  the  exercise  of  its\\ndiscretion refuse him the relief prayed for.  The remedy  is\\npurely  discretionary  and no Court in  those  circumstances\\nwould  exercise @ its discretion in his favour  (Vide  Dewan\\nBahadur Seth Gopal Das Mohta v. Union of India (1),  Baburao\\nNarayan   Savas   v.  Union  of  India(2)   and   Laxmanappa\\nHoonmantappa Janakhandi v. Union of India (3).  Even then he\\nmight merely obtain a relief declaring the legislation ultra\\nvires the Constitution and the Court would not grant him any\\nconsequential  relief  For  that relief  he  would  have  to\\napproach  the regular courts of law, when all  questions  of\\nlaw, apart from the mere constitutionality of the  provision\\nwould  be considered by the Court on a contest  between  the\\npar. ties, e.g., estoppel, acquiescence, limitation and  the\\nlike (Compare our observations in Sales Tax Officer, Banaras\\nv.

The only  thing  which\\nparties  would be concluded by would be the adjudication  as\\nto the ultra vire\\u2019s character of the measure in question and\\nthe  citizen  would not be entitled to  the  relief  claimed\\nmerely for the asking.  These considerations, therefore,  do\\nnot  militate  against the position that  a  citizen  cannot\\nwaive the fundamental rights conferred upon him by Part  III\\nof the Constitution.\\nI fully endorse the opinion expressed by Mahajan, C. J.,  in\\nBehram Khursheed Pesikaka v.

K.  DAS J.-This is an appeal by special leave  from  an\\norder dated January 29, 1958, passed by the Commissioner  of\\nIncome-tax,   Delhi,   respondent  no.  1  before   us,   in\\ncircumstances  which  are somewhat unusual and  out  of  the\\nordinary.   We shall presently relate  those  circumstances;\\nbut  at the very outset it may be stated that two  questions\\nof  far-reaching importance fall for consideration  in  this\\nappeal.   One is the validity of a settlement made under  s.\\nthe  coming  into force of the Constitution on  January  26,\\nthe  Constitution  can be said to have been  waived  by  the\\nappellant in the circumstanoes of this case.\\n\\u2019The  appellant before us is Basheshar Nath, whom  we  shall\\nhereafter call the assessee.  As we have already stated, the\\nCommissioner of Income-tax, Delhi, is the first  respondent,\\nThe second respondent\\nis  the Union of India.  We also allowed the Model  Knitting\\nIndustries, a limited liability Company with its  registered\\noffice  in  Calcutta,  to intervene in the  appeal,  on  the\\nground  that the intervening Company has a case  pending  in\\nthe  High Court of Calcutta where the same questions are  in\\nissue.  We have also heard the intervener in support of  the\\nappeal.\\nOn  behalf of the appellant it has been\\u2019 contended that  the\\nCommissioner of Income-tax, Delhi, is a tribunal within  the\\nmeaning  of  Art,  136 of  the  Constitution  and  exercised\\njudicial  functions  when it passed the  impugned  order  of\\nJanuary  29,  1958.  The respondents pointed  out,  however,\\nthat  the  so-called  order was nothing but  a  reply  which\\nrespondent no.  1 gave to a communication received, from the\\nassessee.  However, the respondents have waived any prelimi-\\nnary objection to the maintainability of the present appeal,\\nand   the  learned  Attorney  General  appearing   for   the\\nrespondents has frankly stated before us that he is  raising\\nno  such preliminary objection, as the Union  Government  is\\nequally  anxious  to have a decision on the  question,  very\\nimportant  from  its  point of view  and  with  far-reaching\\nfinancial  consequences,  as to whether  a  settlement  made\\nunder  s.  8A  of the Act after January 26,  1950,  and  the\\norders passed thereon by the Union Government are valid.  We\\nhave,  therefore, proceeded on the footing that the  present\\nappeal  is competent, and have considered it unnecessary  to\\ndecide  in the abstract the more general question as to  the\\ncircumstances in which an order made by a revenue  authority\\nlike   the  Commissioner  of  Income-tax  partakes  of   the\\ncharacter of A judicial or quasi-judicial order.\\nNow,  for the facts and circumstances which have led  up  to\\nthis  appeal.  The Act received the assent of the  Governor-\\nGeneral  on  April 18, 1947, and came into force on  May  1,\\nreferred  to the Investigation Commission, constitued  under\\ns.  3 of the Act.  The reference was made under s.  5(1)  of\\nthe  Act,  and it ,stated that the  Central  Government  had\\nprima  facie reasons for believing that the assessee  either\\nalone or\\n                    567\\nin  combination  with\\u2019  other  persons  evaded  payment   of\\ntaxation  on income to a substantial extent,  and  therefore\\nthe  case  of  the asseesee was sent  to  the  Investigation\\nCommission  for  investigation and report.   The  period  of\\ninvestigation was from April 1, 1939 to March 31, 1947.  The\\nreport  of the Investigation Commission which has been  made\\navailable to us shows that the case against the assessee was\\nthat he carried on a business of supplying tents,  executing\\ncontract works, and commission agency for some textile mills\\non  a  fairly  extensive scale,  both  individually  and  in\\npartnership  With  his brother.  It appears that  the  total\\nwealth  statement of the assessee was filed on November  10,\\nunder  s. 6(3) of the Act.  From January 8, 1949 to  October\\ncollection  of assessment records of the assessee  from  the\\nincome-tax  authorities  and  of materials  from  the  Civil\\nSupplies  Directorate.   On July 5, 1949, the  total  wealth\\nstatement was received back from the assessee and the order-\\n,sheet  shows  that  on May 26, 1950, (that  is,  after  the\\ncoming  into  force  of  the  Constitution)  the  authorised\\nofficial is-sued a notice to the assessee fixing the hearing\\nfor June 10, 1950.  The assessee then asked for time, and it\\nappears  that for a period of about three years  till  June,\\nheld a preliminary investigation and computed intially  that\\nthe  undisclosed income ,of the assessee for the  period  in\\nquestion   was  Rs.  12,07,000;  on  further  scrutiny   and\\nexamination  of  accounts and after heating  the  assessee\\u2019s\\nexplanation,  the authorised official reduced the amount  in\\nhis  final  report, submitted sometime towards  the  end  of\\nconsidered the report of the authorised official, heard  the\\nassessee,  and came to the conclusion that the total  amount\\nto  be  assessed  in  the hands  of  the  assessee  was  Rs\\u2019\\nInvestigation Commission said:\\n\\\"   During the course of the hearing before us,the  assessee\\nas well as his Auditors applied for a\\nsettlement after admitting liability for the aforesaid  sum.\\nIn  the  circumstances, we consider it proper to  allow  the\\nassessee   the  benefit  of  a  settlement  on   the   lower\\nconcessional basis of 75% of evaded income payable by way of\\ntax and a moderate penalty of Rs, 14,064....... The assessee\\naccepting our findings both as regards the amount of  income\\nthat  escaped assessment and the amount of tax  and  penalty\\npayable, offered a settlement.  In the circumstances, we re-\\ncommend  the acceptance by the Government of the  assessee\\u2019s\\noffer of a settlement.\\\"\\nThe  Central Government accepted the settlement under s.  8A\\nof  the  Act and on July 5, 1954, passed an order  under  s.\\ntax  Officer concerned for a sum of Rs. 3,50,000  (including\\nthe  penalty  of  Rs. 14,064) on the  assessee  and  further\\ndirecting that \\\" all such other proceedings under the Indian\\nIncome-tax Act or under any other law, as may be  necessary,\\nshould be taken with a view to enforcing the payment of  the\\ndemand  and the terms and conditions of settlement.\\\"  Though\\nunder the terms of settlement no instalments were given,  it\\nappears  that the assessee was allowed to pay the amount  at\\nthe rate of Rs. 5,000 per month.  It further appears that up\\nto and including September 8, 1957, the assessee had paid in\\nall a sum of Rs. 1,28,000 towards the demand.  In  December,\\nv. The Commissioner of Income tax, Madras (1), in which  the\\nmajority  of Judges held that s. 5(1) of the Act  was  ultra\\nvires  the  Constitution,  as  it  was  discriminatory   and\\nviolative of the fundamental right guaranteed by Art. 14  of\\nthe Constitution by reason of two amendments which were made\\nin  s. 34 of the Indian Income-tax Act 1922-one in  1948  by\\nthe  enactment of the Income. tax and Business  Profits  Tax\\n(Amendment) Act, 1948 (48 of 1948) and the other in 1954  by\\nthe enactment of the Indian Income-tax (Amendment) Act, 1954\\n(33  of  1954).  Sometime earlier than the  aforesaid  deci-\\nsion, the Income-tax Officer concerned had sent a\\n(1)  [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247,\\n                    569\\nrecovery  certificate to the Collector, New Delhi,  and  the\\nassessee  stated that in execution of the  said  certificate\\nhis  properties  situated  in  Dharamsala  and  Hissar  were\\nattached.   On  December  27, 1957,  the  assessee  filed  a\\npetition  to  the Income-tax Commissioner, Delhi,  in  which\\nafter stating the relevant facts, the assessee claimed that,\\nafter  the  decision in Muthiah\\u2019s case (1),  the  settlement\\nmade under s. 8A of the Act had no force and was not binding\\non   him:  the  assessee  then  prayed  that  the   attached\\nproperties  should  be  released  from  attachment  and  the\\namounts recovered under the terms of settlement refunded  to\\nhim.   On January 29, 1958, the Commissioner  of  Income-tax\\nsent the following reply-\\n\\\"  With reference to your petition dated 27th December  1957\\nregarding  the settlement arrived at under section 8A(2)  of\\nthe Taxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947,\\non you.\\nof  instalments  which  you have not paid  recently  by  5th\\nFebruary,  1958 and also to continue making the payments  in\\naccordance  with the instalments\\u2019 scheme agreed to,  failing\\nwhich  the recovery proceedings will be  vigorously  pursued\\nthrough the usual recovery channels.\\\"\\nThe assessee asked for and obtained special leave from  this\\nCourt  on  February 17, 1958, to appeal from  the  aforesaid\\norder.  In the appeal as orginally filed in pursuance of the\\nspecial  leave granted to the assessee, the  prayer  portion\\nwas  inadvertently  left out.   Subsequently,  the  assessee\\nprayed  that-(a) the report of the Investigation  Commission\\ndated  May 24, 1954, be quashed, (b) the settlement made  on\\nthe  basis  of the report and the directions  given  by  the\\nCentral Government in pursuance thereof and the  proceedings\\nfor  recovery of arrears of tax be all quashed, and (c)  the\\namounts  already  recovered may be ordered to  be  refunded.\\nWith  regard to the last prayer, we may state here  that  it\\nwas not pressed before us and we are relieved from the task,\\nat least in this appeal, of\\n(1)  [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247.\\ndeciding in what circumstances and on what considerations  a\\nrefund of tax voluntarily paid can be claimed.\\nTherefore, the first and foremost question before us is  the\\nvalidity  of the settlement made under S. 8A of  ,-the  Act.\\nOn behalf of the assessee the main argument is that s.  5(1)\\nof  the Act having been held ultra vires  the  Constitution,\\nthe  very  foundation for the report  of  the  Investigation\\nCommission has disappeared and a settlement based thereon is\\nneither  valid,  nor can it be enforced.  On behalf  of  the\\nrespondents, the learned Attorney General has contended that\\nthere  is no decision of this Court which has held  that  s.\\nof  the various sections of the Act, it will be  found  that\\nthere   are   two  separate  and  distinct   procedures   or\\njurisdictions which the Investigation Commission may  follow\\nor  exercise: one is investigation and the other relates  to\\nsettlement.    He  has  submitted  that   the   jurisdiction\\nconferred on the Investigation Commission under s. 8A, which\\nwas inserted in the Act in 1949 by s. 33 of Act 67 of  1949,\\nis  not affected by the decision in Muthiah\\u2019s case (1),  and\\nif   the  Investigation  Commission  had   jurisdiction   to\\nentertain  an application from the assessee for  settlement,\\napprove of the same, and refer it to the Central Government,\\nthe  latter  had also jurisdiction to accept it  under  sub-\\ns.(1) and make necessary orders under sub.s. (2) of s. 8A.In\\nshort, the argument of the learned Attorney General is  that\\nthere is nothing in Muthiah\\u2019s decision (1), which renders s.\\nIt  is  necessary  to  read  at  this  stage  the   relevant\\nprovisions  of  the  Act in so far as  they  bear  upon  the\\nproblems  before  us.  We have said that the Act  came  into\\nforce on May 1, 1947.  This was before the coming into force\\nof  the  Constitution  of  India, and  no  question  of  the\\nviolation  of  any  fundamental  rights  guaranteed  by  the\\nConstitution  arose  on  that date.  Section 3  of  the  Act\\nempowers  the Central Government (now Union  Government)  to\\nconstitute   a  Commission  to  be  called  the   Income-tax\\nInvestigation\\n(1)  [1955] 2 S. C.

Subsection (2) of s. 8 gives  the\\nCentral  Government power to direct reopening of  assessment\\nproceedings  on the report of the  Commission.

Section 10, the  last\\nsection, gives the Central Government power to make rules.\\nThe  above  recital  gives a brief conspectus  of  the  main\\nprovisions  of the Act.  It is necessary now to refer  to  a\\nfew  earlier decisions of this Court with regard to some  of\\nthese  provisions.   The earliest in point of  time  is  the\\ndecision  in  Suraj Mall Mohta and Co. v. A.  V.  Viswanatha\\nSastri where sub-s. (4) of S. 5 of the Act and the procedure\\nprescribed  by the Act in so far as it affected the  persons\\nproceeded  against under that sub-section, were held  to  be\\ndiscriminatory  and  therefore void and  unenforceable.   No\\nopinion  was, however, expressed on the validity of s.  5(1)\\nof the Act.\\n(1)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 448.\\nIn  Shree  Meenakshi  Mills  Ltd.,  Madurai  v.  Sri  A.  V.\\nViswanatha  Sastri  (1), it was held that after  the  coming\\ninto  force  on  July 17, 1954,  of  the  Indian  Income-tax\\n(Amendment)  Act, 1954, (33 of 1954) which operated  on  the\\nsame  field as s. 5(1) of the Act, the provisions  of  s.  5\\n(1) became void and unenforceable as being discriminatory in\\ncharacter.   It was further held that when an Act was  valid\\nin  its entirety before the date of the  Constitution,  that\\npart  of the proceedings regulated by the special  procedure\\nand  taken during the pre-Constitution period could  not  be\\nquestioned  how. ever discriminator it might have been,  but\\nthe  discriminatory procedure could not be  continued  after\\nthe  coming  into force of the Constitution.  In  that  case\\n(Meenakshi Mills\\u2019 case(1)) the Investigation Commission  had\\nnot even commenced the proceedings though a period of  seven\\nyears had elapsed and the investigation was pending when the\\nwrit  petitions were filed.  In those circumstances  it  was\\nheld   that   the  proceedings  before   the   Investigation\\nCommission  which had become discriminatory could no  longer\\nbe continued.  Then came the decision in M. CT.  Muthiah  v.\\nThe,  Commissioner  of  Income-tax,  Madras(2).   The  facts\\nrelevant  to  that  decision  were  that  the  Investigation\\nCommission held an enquiry into three cases and submitted  a\\nreport  on August 26, 1952, finding a particular sum  to  be\\nthe undisclosed income during the investigation period.  The\\nCentral  Government accepted the report and passed an  order\\nunder  s.  8(2) of the Act on September 16,  1952.   Notices\\nunder  s. 34 of the Indian Income-tax Act were  then  issued\\nand  reassessments  except  for one year were  made  on  the\\nfindings of the Commission, which were treated as final  and\\nconclusive.   The  re-assessment orders were served  on  the\\nassessees  in February and May 1954.  On December  6,  1954,\\nthe  assessees  filed their writ petitions  challenging  the\\nconstitutionality  of S. 5 (1) of the Act.  It was  held  by\\nthe majority that s. 5 (1) was discriminatory and  violative\\nof  the  fundamental right guaranteed under Art. 14  of  the\\nConstitution,  because s. 34 of the Indian  Income-tax  Act,\\n(1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 787.\\n(2) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247.\\namended  in  1948 operated on the same field  and  from  and\\nafter  January 26, 1950, it included the strip of  territory\\nwhich  was also occupied by s. 5 (1) and  two  substantially\\ndifferent  laws of procedure, one more , prejudicial to  the\\nassessee than the other, could not be allowed to operate  on\\nthe same field in view of the , guarantee of Art. 14 of  the\\nConstitution.  In the result it was held that barring  those\\ncases  which were already concluded by reports made  by  the\\nCommission and directions given by Government before January\\nfor   investigation  as  also  assessment  or   reassessment\\nproceedings which were pending on January 26, 1950, were hit\\nby Art. 14.  The -assessment orders were accordingly quashed\\nas being unconstitutional.\\nNow, we come back to the problems before us: (1) what is the\\neffect of Muthia\\u2019s decision(1) in the present ease, and  (2)\\ndoes  the  Act contemplate two separate  and  distinct,  but\\nseverable,  procedures  or jurisdictions  -one  relating  to\\ninvestigation and the other to settlement, so that the  vice\\nof  discrimination  (if any) attaches to  the  investigation\\nprocedure only and not to the other ?\\nWe  do not see how the learned Attorney General  can  escape\\nfrom  the  position  that Muthia\\u2019s  decision  (1)  holds  in\\nexpress terms that s. 5 (1) of the Act was hit by Art. 14 of\\nthe  Constitution on and after January 26, 1950.  The  ratio\\nof the decision was thus explained in the majority  judgment\\nat page 1260, 1261:-\\n\\\"  After the 8th September, 1948, there were two  procedures\\nsimultaneously  in operation, the one under Act XXX of  1947\\nand the other under the Indian Income tax Act with reference\\nto persons who fell within the same class or category, viz.,\\nthat  of the substantial evaders of income-tax.   After  the\\nthe  class of substantial evaders of income-tax  were  dealt\\nwith  under  the drastic and  summary  procedure  prescribed\\nunder Act XXX of 1947, while other\\n(1)  [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247.\\npersons  who  fell  within the  same  class  of  substantial\\nevaders  of  income-tax  could  be  dealt  with  under   the\\nprocedure  prescribed  in the Indian  Income-tax  Act  after\\nservice of notice upon them under the amended section 34 (1)\\nof  the  Act.  Different persons, though falling  under  the\\nsame class or category of substantial evaders of income-tax,\\nwould, therefore, be subject to different procedures, one  a\\nsummary  and  drastic  procedure  and  the  other  a  normal\\nprocedure  which gave to the assessees various rights  which\\nwere  denied to those who were specially treated  under  the\\nprocedure prescribed in Act XXX of 1947.\\nThe  legislative competence being there,  these  provisions,\\nthough discriminatory, could not have been challenged before\\nthe   advent  of  the  Constitution.   When,  however,   the\\nConstitution came into force on the 26th January, 1950,  the\\ncitizens  obtained the fundamental rights enshrined in  Part\\nIII  of the Constitution including the right to equality  of\\nlaws  and  equal protection of laws enacted  in  article  14\\nthereof,  and  whatever may have been  the  position  before\\nJanuary  26,  1950, it was open to the  persons  alleged  to\\nbelong to the class of substantial evaders thereafter to ask\\nas  to  why some of them were subjected to the  summary  and\\ndrastic  procedure prescribed in Act XXX of 1947 and  others\\nwere subjected to the normal procedure prescribed in section\\nthe procedure prescribed in Act XXX of 1947 being  obviously\\ndiscriminatory and, therefore, violative of the  fundamental\\nright guaranteed under article 14 of the Constitution.\\\"\\nThat ratio is equally applicable in the present case, and if\\ns. 5(1) of the Act is unenforceable after January 26,  1950,\\nthe reference made thereunder against the assessee must also\\nfall after that date and with it must go overboard all  that\\nwas done under the drastic and summary procedure  prescribed\\nunder the Act after January 26,1950.  Two possible arguments\\nthat  (1) substantial evaders whose s were referred  by  the\\nCentral Government for investigation by the Commission\\n                    579\\nbefore  September 1, 1948, formed a class by themselves  and\\n(2)  that proceedings having started before  the  Commission\\nunder a reference valid at the time when it was made  cannot\\nbe  affected by any subsequent amendment of  the  Income-tax\\nArt,  1922,  were  raised, but not accepted  in  Suraj  Mall\\nMohta\\u2019s  Meenakshi  Mills\\u2019  or Muthia\\u2019s case  (1)  (2)  (3).\\nThere  has  been some argument before us as to how  the  two\\nprocedures-one  prescribed under the Income-tax  Act,  1922,\\nand  the other under the Act-compare and contrast with  each\\nother;  but  this is a point which was  canvassed  at  great\\nlength  in  each of the three cases mentioned  above.   This\\nCourt   found  in  unequivocal  terms  that  the   procedure\\nprescribed  under the Act was more summary and drastic,  and\\nin  Suraj  Mall  Mohta\\u2019s case  the  substantial  differences\\nbetween the two procedures were summarised at pp. 463-466 of\\nthe  report.   We do not propose to cover  the  same  ground\\nagain, but cop-tent ourselves with drawing attention to what\\nwas  pointedly said in Suraj Mall Mohta\\u2019s case namely,  that\\nit  was conceded on behalf of Government that the  procedure\\nprescribed by the impugned Act in ss. 6 and 7, which we have\\nread earlier, was more drastic than the procedure prescribed\\nin  ss.  37  and 38 of the Indian Income-tax  Act.   It  was\\nstated   therein  that  though  in  the  first   stages   of\\ninvestigation  there  was some similarity  between  the  two\\nprocedures, the overall picture was not the same.\\nThe learned Attorney General has not seriously contested the\\ncorrectness  of this position, but has argued that  what  we\\nare  concerned  with  in the present case is  not  the  mere\\npossibility  of a differential treatment, but what  actually\\nwas  done  by  the Commission in the  case  of  the  present\\nassessee after January 26, 1950.  He has submitted that  the\\nassessee was not subjected to any differential treatment  in\\nfact,  and has invoked to his aid the ratio of our  decision\\nin Syed Qasim Razvi v. The State of Hyderabad (4), where the\\nmajority  judgment laid down the following tests: in a  case\\nwhere part of the trial cannot be challenged as\\n(1) [1955] 1S.C.R.448\\n(2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 787.\\n(3)  [1955) 2 S.C.R. 1247.\\n(4)  [1953] S.C.R. 589.\\nbad, it is incumbent on the court to consider, first whether\\nthe  discriminatory provisions of the law can  be  separated\\nfrom  the  rest  and even without them  a  fair  measure  of\\nequality  in  the matter of procedure can  be  secured,  and\\nsecondly,  whether the procedure -actually followed \\u2019did  or\\ndid  not, proceed upon the discriminatory provisions and  it\\nwas  stated  that a; mere threat or possibility  of  unequal\\ntreatment  was not sufficient to invalidate  the  subsequent\\nproceedings.   A  reference was there made  to  the  earlier\\ndecisions,  of this Court in Keshavan Madhava Xenon  v.  The\\nState  of Bombay (1), and Lachmandas Kewalram Ahuja  v.  The\\nState  of Bombay (2 ), and the decision in  Lachmandas  case\\n(supra), again a majority decision, was distinguished on two\\ngrounds: first, the question as to whether after eliminating\\nthe  discriminatory  provisions  it was  still  possible  to\\nsecure a fair measure of equality with the normal  procedure\\nwas neither raised nor considered ; secondly, it was assumed\\nthat  it was not possible to proceed with the trial  without\\nfollowing the discriminatory procedure and as that procedure\\nbecame  void on the coming into force of  the  Constitution,\\nthe jurisdiction to proceed under that procedure came to  an\\nend.  Applying the tests laid down in the majority  decision\\nof Syed Qasim Razvi\\u2019s case (3), the learned Attorney General\\nhas  contended that in the present case  the  discriminatory\\nprovisions  can be separated from the rest of the  Act,  and\\nthe assessee was not in fact subjected to any discriminatory\\nprocedure.   He has sought to distinguish Muthia\\u2019s  case  on\\nthe same ground, viz., that the re-assessments made in  that\\ncase were actually based on a discriminatory procedure.\\nIn our view the ratio of the majority decision in Syed Qasim\\nRazvi\\u2019s  case (3) has no application in the case  under  our\\nconsideration,  and the principle which applies is what  was\\nlaid down in Lachmandas\\u2019s case (2). The majority decision is\\nSyed  Qasim Razvi\\u2019s case proceeded on the finding (to  quote\\nthe  words  of  Mukherjea, J., who  delivered  the  majority\\njudgment)  that \\\" although there were deviations in  certain\\nparticulars,\\n(1) [1951] S. C. R. 228.           (2) [1952] S. C. R. 71O.\\n(.3) [1953] S. C. R. 589.\\n                    581\\nthe  accused  had  substantially the  benefit  of  a  normal\\ntrial\\\".   The minority judgments, however, very  pertinently\\npointed  out  that  the discriminatory  provisions  were  an\\nintegral  part  of the Regulation under  which  the  accused\\nperson in that case was tried and in fact the discriminatory\\nprovisions were applied.  Bose, J. (as he then was expressed\\nthe  view  (at p. 618) \\\" that in testing the validity  of  a\\nlaw,  it is irrelevant to consider what has been done  under\\nit,  for  a  law is either constitutional  or  not  and  the\\nvalidity  or  otherwise  cannot depend upon  what  has  been\\naccomplished under its provisions.\\\"\\nIt  is,  we think, unnecessary to go  into  the  controversy\\nwhich arises out -of the two views expressed above.  For the\\npresent  case,  it  is  sufficient  to  say  that  (1)   the\\ndiscriminatory  provisions  are  an  integral  part  of  the\\nprocedure prescribed under the Act which cannot be separated\\nfrom  the  rest; and (2) we are satisfied  that  the  report\\nwhich  led to the settlement was made by  the  Investigation\\nCommission  in  pursuance of and as a direct result  of  the\\ndiscriminatory  procedure  which it followed.   Indeed,  the\\nInvestigation  Commission  followed the  only  procedure  of\\ninvestigation prescribed under the Act, which was a  drastic\\nand summary procedure, and if that procedure became void  on\\nthe coming into force of the Constitution, the  jurisdiction\\nof  the Investigation Commission practically came to an  end\\n(see Lachmandas\\u2019s case, supra).\\nIt  is  necessary to explain here why we cannot  accept  the\\ncontention  of the learned Attorney General that  there  are\\ntwo procedures or two jurisdictions under the Act.  What  in\\nsubstance is the effect of the provisions of the Act, in  so\\nfar as they relate to the Commission\\u2019s duty under s. 3  (b)?\\nThe  Commission  receives a reference under s. 5 (1)  if  it\\ndoes  not proceed under s. 5 (2), it exercises such  of  its\\npowers  under  s.  6 as it  considers  necessary.   It  then\\nfollows  the  procedure laid down in s. 7  and  submits  its\\nreport  under s. 8. On that report, the  Central  Government\\ntakes  action  under s. 8 (2).  If,  however,  the  assessee\\napplies  for settlement, even then the Commission  has  the,\\nduty to report to Government if the terms of settlement are\\napproved  by it.  To fulfil this duty, the  Commission  must\\nget the materials by exercising its powers under s. 6 and by\\nfollowing  the procedure laid down in s. 7. That is  exactly\\nwhat  was done in the present case.  An authorised  official\\nwas  asked to examine the accounts etc. under s. 6 (3).   He\\nexamined  the  accounts and submitted an interim  report  in\\nregard to inspection of documents, examination of  witnesses\\netc.  He then submitted a final report.  The Commission then\\nheard the assesee on May 19, 1954, and reserved orders.   On\\nMay 20, 1954, after the assessee knew what the final finding\\nof  the Commission was going to be, he filed an  application\\nfor  settlement.  The Commission made its final report  four\\ndays  after.   It  is difficult to  understand  how  in  the\\ncircumstances  stated  above,  it  can  be  said  that   the\\nCommission  followed a non-discriminatory procedure or  that\\nit  had two jurisdictions-one relating to investigation  and\\nthe  other to settlement.  The jurisdiction was really  one,\\nand  the  procedure followed also the same.  It  is  not  as\\nthough the Act provided a separate procedure for purposes of\\neffecting  a  settlement;  nor  is  this  a  case  where   a\\nsettlement  has  been  made  without  applying  any  of  the\\nprovisions relating to investigation.  A full  investigation\\nwas  made, and after the assessee had been subjected to  the\\ndrastic  and  summary procedure under the Act, he  was  told\\nwhat the result of the investigation was.  Then, he made  an\\napplication  for  settlement,  which  was  approved  by  the\\nCommission under s. 8A.\\nWe  are  accordingly of the view that the  learned  Attorney\\nGeneral  has failed to make out his case that  (1)  Muthia\\u2019s\\ndecision (1) does not apply and (2) the settlement under  s.\\nseverability   or  non-application  of  the   discriminatory\\nprocedure under the Act in the case of the assessee..\\nThis  brings me to the second question, that of waiver of  a\\nfundamental  right, which is as important as it is  complex.\\nIt is a question on which unfortunately we\\n(1) [1955] 2 S.C.R.1247.\\nhave  not been able to achieve unanimity.  It is beset  with\\nthis initial difficulty that the present appeal is not  from\\na  judgment  or order rendered after the trial  of  properly\\nframed issues; it is from an order which merely rejected the\\nprayer  of  the  assessee that his  properties  attached  in\\nexecution of the recovery certificate should be released and\\nthe amounts paid under the terms of the settlement refunded.\\nThe  question of waiver was neither raised, nor  tried;  and\\nthe  necessary facts were not ascertained or  determined  by\\nthe revenue authority concerned.  Unfortunately, the  filing\\nof  a  statement  of  their case by  the  parties  was  also\\ndispensed  with,  the  result  whereof  has  been  that  the\\nquestion of waiver has been urged for the first time in  the\\ncourse  of  arguments here.  We have,  however,  heard  full\\narguments  on  it,  and  proceed  to  consider  it  on  such\\nmaterials as have been placed before us.  It is necessary to\\nmake one point clear.  The respondents have raised the  plea\\nof  waiver, and the onus lies heavily on them  to  establish\\nthe essential requirements in support of the plea.\\nTwo   points  arise  in  this  connection:  (1)   have   the\\nrespondents  established,  on the materials before  us,  the\\nnecessary  facts on which a plea of waiver can be founded  ;\\nand  (2)  if so, can a fundamental right guaranteed  by  the\\nConstitution  be  waived  at all.  If  the  first  point  is\\nanswered  in  the  negative, the second point  need  not  be\\nanswered in the abstract.  On behalf of the respondents,  it\\nhas  been submitted that assuming (without  conceding)  that\\nthe discriminatory provisions of the Act were applied in the\\ncase  of the assessee before he asked for a settlement,  the\\nmaterials  on  record -show that he never  objected  to  the\\nprocedure  adopted, voluntarily asked for a settlement,  got\\nby the settlement the benefit. of reducing his liability for\\nboth  tax and penalty, and paid without demur the  following\\ninstalments (some even after Muthia\\u2019s decision (1) )\\n(1)  [1955] 2 S.C.P. 1247.\\n    Payments made up to April 55         10,000\\n    Payment made on      10-5-55          5,000\\n                  19-6-55          5,000\\n                   7-7-55          5,000\\n                  13-8-55          5,OOO\\n                   7-9-55          5,000\\n                  15-10-55         5,000\\n                  10-11-55         5,000\\n                  15-12-55         5,000\\n                   8-2-56          5,000\\n                  13-2-56          5,000\\n                   7-3-56          5,000\\n                  14-5-56          5,000\\n                  19-5-56          5,000\\n                  13-6-56          5,000\\n                   6-8-56          5,000\\n                   7-9-56          5,000\\n                   9-10-56         5,000\\n                  10-11-56         5,000\\n                  23-12-56         5,000\\n                  14-1-57          5,000\\n                  29-3-57          5,000\\n                   4-6-57          5,000\\n                   8-9-57          8,000\\n                                ----------\\n                                 1,28,000\\n                                -----------\\nThe  learned  Attorney  General  has  in  this-   connection\\nreferred  us  to the application for  settlement  which  the\\nassessee  had made to the Commission, wherein the  following\\nstatements were made:-\\n\\\"  in view of the fact that though no  disclosure  statement\\nhad  been made before the submission of his reports  by  the\\nauthorised  official,, still during the enquiry  before  the\\nCommission,,  the assessee and his auditors  admitted  their\\nliability  to  tax in respect of the aforesaid  sum  of  Rs.\\nassessee  should be granted the benefit of a  settlement  on\\nthe  lower concessional basis of payment of 75 per cent.  of\\nthe  undisclosed income by way of tax.  The  Commission  was\\nalso  of the opinion that the assessee should pay by way  of\\npenalty a sum of Rs. 14,064.\\n                    585\\nThe  assessee accepts the conclusions of the  Commission  as\\nregards  the amount of income that escaped  assessment,  the\\ntax payable thereon and the penalty payable as aforesaid.\\\"\\nOn  the  basis  of these statements,  the  learned  Attorney\\nGeneral  has  argued  that there is no  foundation  for  the\\nsuggestion   made  on  behalf  of  the  assessee  that   the\\napplication for settlement was made \\\" under the pressure  of\\ncircumstances  and in view of the coercive machinery of  the\\nAct.\\\" He has submitted that the necessary facts on which the\\nplea of waiver is founded have been established, and he  has\\nrelied on three cases decided by this Court, where according\\nto him the effect of the decisions was to accept such a plea\\nin circumstances very similar: Dewan Bahadur Seth Gopal  Das\\nMohta v. The Union of India(1); Baburao Narayanrao Sanas  v.\\nThe   Union  of  India  (2);  and  Laxnanappa   Hanumantappa\\nJamkhandi  v.  The  Union  of India (3)  On  behalf  of  the\\nassessee, it is contended on the contrary that the necessary\\nfacts  to found a plea of waiver are totally absent  in  the\\npresent  case,  and none of the  aforesaid  three  decisions\\nwhich were all pronounced on the same day proceed on a  plea\\nof waiver.\\nTwo  of  the three decisions referred to above relate  to  a\\nsettlement  made under s. 8A and the third to an order  made\\nunder  s.  8(2) of the Act.  All the  three  decisions  were\\npronounced  on  applications  made  under  Art.  32  of  the\\nConstitution,  and  not on any appeal from an order  of  the\\nrevenue  authority.   In  Gopal Das  Mohta\\u2019s  case  (1)  the\\nargument  urged was, inter alia, that ss. 5, 6, 7 and  8  of\\nthe Act were invalid and ultra vires as they contravened the\\nprovisions  of  Arts.  14,  19  (1)  (f),  and  31  of   the\\nConstitution  and  the  prayer  made  was  that  the  entire\\nproceedings should be quashed as also all orders made by the\\nCentral  Government in pursuance of the settlement under  s.\\nwho delivered the , judgment of the Court said at p. 776-\\n(1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 773.         (2) [1954] 26 I.T.R. 725.\\n(3)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 769.\\n\\\"  In  our judgment this petition  is  wholly  misconceived.\\nWhatever tax the petitioner has already paid, or whatever is\\nstill recoverable from him, is being recovered on the  basis\\nof  the  settlement  proposed by him  and  accepted  by  the\\nCentral Government.  Because Of his request for a settlement\\nno assessment was made against him by following the whole of\\nthe  -procedure  of the Income-tax Act.  In  this  situation\\nunless  and  until  the petitioner can  establish  that  his\\nconsent  was  improperly procured and that he is  not  bound\\nthereby  he  cannot  complain that any  of  his  fundamental\\nrights  has been contravened for which he can  claim  relief\\nunder  art.  32 of the Constitution.  Article 32  of  \\u2019,,the\\nConstitution   is  not  intended  for  relief  against   the\\nvoluntary actions of a person.  His remedy, if any, lies  in\\nother appropriate proceedings.\\\"\\nThere  has been a good deal of argument before us as to  the\\ntrue  effect of the decision in Gopal Das Mohta\\u2019s case  (1).\\nWhile  I recognise that the reason stated for the  decision,\\nviz.,  that  Art.  32 is not  intended  for  relief  against\\nvoluntary  actions  of a person, comes very near  to  saying\\nthat  a  person has waived his protection in  a  given  case\\nsince  whatever  injury he may incur is due to his  own  act\\nrather  than  to  the  enforcement  of  an  unconstitutional\\nmeasure  against him, I am unable to hold that the  decision\\nproceeded strictly on the doctrine of waiver; it is  perhaps\\ntrue  to say that some of the observations made therein  are\\nof a \\\" Delphic nature to be translated into concreteness  by\\nthe process of litigating elucidation\\\" (to borrow the  words\\nof Frankfurter, J., in Machinists v. Gonzales (2).  It seems\\nto  me  that the decision proceeded more upon the  scope  of\\nArt. 32 than upon the doctrine of waiver.  I am fortified in\\nthis view by the circumstance that in a decision given  only\\na  month earlier (see Behram Khurshed Pesikaka v. The  State\\nof  Bombay  (3)) the same learned  Chief  Justice  expressed\\nhimself strongly, though tentatively, against introducing in\\nour  Constitution  the doctrine of waiver as  enunciated  by\\nsome   American   Judges   in   construing   the    American\\nConstitution, without a full discussion of the matter.   The\\nreport of Gopal\\n(1) [1955] 1 S.C.P. 773.       (2) (1958) 356 U.S. 617,619\\n(3) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 613 653,654.\\nDas  Mohta\\u2019s case (1) does not contain any reference to  the\\ndoctrine  of  waiver,  and it is  obvious  that  no  ,fuller\\ndiscussion  of the doctrine took place in that case.  It  is\\nnot, therefore, reasonable to hold that the effect of  Gopal\\nDas Mohta\\u2019s case is to uphold the doctrine of waiver.   Babu\\nRao\\u2019s case (2) merely followed Gopal Das Mohta (1) and  gave\\nno separate reasons.  Laxmanappa Jamkhandi\\u2019s case (3)  dealt\\nwith an order under s. 8(2) of the Act and said at p. 772:-\\n\\\"  From  the  facts  stated  above  it  is  plain  that  the\\nproceedings  taken  under  the  impugned  Act  XXX  of  1947\\nconcluded   so  far  as  the  Investigation  Commission   is\\nconcerned  in  September, 1952, more than two  years  before\\nthis  petition was presented in this Court.  The  assessment\\norders under the Income-tax Act itself were made against the\\npetitioner in November, 1953.  In these circumstances we are\\nof  the opinion that -he is entitled to no relief under  the\\nprovisions  of Article 32 of the Constitution.  It was  held\\nby  this Court in Ramjilal v. Income-tax Officer,  Mohindar-\\ngarh,  [1951]  S.C.R. 127, that as there is a  special  pro.\\nvision in Article 265 of the Constitution, that no tax shall\\nbe  levied or collected except by authority of  law,  clause\\n(1)  of Article 31 must therefore be regarded  as  concerned\\nwith   deprivation  of  property  otherwise  than   by   the\\nimposition  or collection of tax, and inasmuch as the  right\\nconferred  by Art. 265 is not a right conferred by Part  III\\nof the Constitution, it could not be enforced under  Article\\npetition  under  Article  32  is  not  maintainable  in  the\\nsituation  that  has arisen and that even otherwise  in  the\\npeculiar circumstances that have arisen it would not be just\\nand proper to direct the issue of any of the writs the issue\\nof which is discretionary with this Court.\\\"\\nHere,  again,  there  is no reference  to  the  doctrine  of\\nwaiver,  and the case was decided on the ambit and scope  of\\nArt. 32 of the Constitution.\\nI  would hold, therefore, that the decisions of  this  Court\\nrelied on by the learned Attorney General do\\n(1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 773.        (2) [1954] 26 I.T.R. 725.\\n(3)[1955] 1 S.C.R.769.\\nnot help him in establishing waiver.  Let me now examine the\\ncircumstances  on which the learned Attorney General  founds\\nhis  plea of waiver.  Indeed, it is true that  the  assessee\\nsubmitted to the discriminatory procedure applied to him  by\\nthe  Commission; he also asked for a settlement under  which\\nhe  agreed  to pay 75% of his alleged tax  liability  and  a\\nsmall amount of penalty; he made some payment in instalments\\neven  after Muthia\\u2019s decision in December, 1955.   Do  these\\ncircumstances amount to waiver ? It is to be remembered that\\nin  1953-1954 when the discriminatory procedure of  the  Act\\nwas  applied to him and the report against him was  made  by\\nthe  Commission  on  which  the  settlement  is  based,  the\\nassessee  did not know, nor had it been declared by a  court\\nof competent jurisdiction that s. 5(1) of the Act was  ultra\\nvires.  In his application for a settlement, he said clearly\\nin  paragraph  3 that the Commission announced - it  as  its\\nview  that  the income, profits and gains that  had  escaped\\nassessment  in the hands of the assessee was  Rs.  4,47,915.\\nThe  assessee also knew that under the Act this finding  was\\nfinal  and binding on him.  If in these  circumstances,  the\\nassessee made an application for settlement, can it be  said\\nthat  it is a voluntary or intentional relinquishment  of  a\\nknown right ? I venture to think not.  It has been said that\\n\\u2019  waiver\\u2019 is a troublesome term in the law.  The  generally\\naccepted connotation is that to constitute \\u2019 waiver\\u2019,  there\\nmust  be an intentional relinquishment of a known  right  or\\nthe  voluntary  relinquishment  or abandonment  of  a  known\\nexisting  legal  right,  or  conduct  such  as  warrants  an\\ninference  of  the  relinquishment  of  a  known  right   or\\nprivilege.   Waiver differs from estoppel in the sense  that\\nit  is contractual and is an agreement to release or not  to\\nassert a right; estoppel is a rule of evidence. (See  Dawson\\nBank  Limited v. Nippon Menkwa Kabushiki Kaisha) (1).   What\\nis  the known legal right which the  assessee  intentionally\\nrelinquished or agreed to release in 1953-1954 ? He did  not\\nknow then that any part of the Act was invalid, and I  doubt\\nif in\\n(1) (1935) L.R.62 I.A.100,108.\\n                    589\\nthe  circumstances of this case, a plea of \\u2019waiver\\u2019  can  be\\nfounded on the maxim of \\u2019ignorance of law is no excuse\\u2019.   I\\ndo not think that the maxim \\u2019ignorance of law is no  excuse\\u2019\\ncan  be  carried to the extent of saying that  every  person\\nmust be presumed to know that a piece of legislation enacted\\nby  a legislature of competent jurisdiction must be held  to\\nbe-invalid, in case it prescribes a differential  treatment,\\nand he must, therefore, refuse to submit to it or incur  the\\nperil  of the bar of waiver being raised against him.  I  do\\nnot think that such pre-science is a necessary corollary  of\\nthe maxim.  On the contrary, the presumption, if any,  which\\noperated at the relevant time was the presumption that a law\\npassed by a competent legislature is valid, unless  declared\\nunconstitutional  by  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction.\\nFurthermore, I do not think that any inference of waiver can\\nbe retrospectively drawn from the instalments paid in  1956-\\nalready paid is no longer a live issue before us.  It would,\\nI  think, be going too far to hold that  every  unsuspecting\\nsubmission  to a law, subsequently declared to  be  invalid,\\nmust  give  rise  to  a plea  of  waiver:  this  would  make\\nconstitutional  rights  depend  for their  vitality  on  the\\naccident of a timely challenge and render them illusory to a\\nvery large extent.\\nI  hold,  therefore,  that  the  necessary  foundation   for\\nsustaining  the  plea of waiver has not been  laid  in  this\\ncase,  and the onus being on the respondents, the plea  must\\nfail.\\nIn view of my finding that the necessary foundation on facts\\nfor sustaining the plea of waiver has not been laid in  this\\ncase, it becomes unnecessary to decide, in the abstract, the\\nfurther  question  if  a  right guaranteed  by  any  of  the\\nprovisions in Part III of the Constitution can be waived  at\\nall.   I  am of the view -that this Court should  indeed  be\\nrigorous  in avoiding to pronounce on constitutional  issues\\nwhere  a  reason.  able  alternative  exists;  for  we  have\\nconsistently  followed  the two principles (a)  that  \\\"  the\\nCourt  will not anticipate a question of constitutional  law\\nin\\nadvance  of  the  necessity  of deciding  it  \\\"  (Weaver  on\\nConstitutional  Law,  p. 69) and (b) \\\" the  Court  will  not\\nformulate  a  rule  of constitutional law  broader  than  is\\nrequired by the precise facts to which it is to be applied \\\"\\n(ibid, p. 69).\\nMy Lord the Chief Justice and my learned brother Kapur,  J.,\\nhave  however expressed the view that the fundamental  right\\nguaranteed  under  Art.  14 cannot  be  waived;  my  learned\\nbrethren,  Bhagwati and Subba Rao, JJ., have  expressed  the\\nview  that none of the fundamental rights guaranteed by  the\\nConstitution can be waived.\\nI  greatly  regret  to have to say that I  have  come  to  a\\nconclusion  different  from  theirs  with  regard  to   this\\nquestion,  and  as they have thought fit  to  express  their\\nviews  on  it  proceed now to explain why I have come  to  a\\nconclusion  different from those of my learned  brethren  on\\nthis question.\\nThis  question  was mooted, though not  fully  answered,  in\\nBehram Khurshed Pesikaka\\u2019s case (1).  Venkatarama Aiyar, J.,\\nexpressed  his  views  at pages 638 to 643  of  the  report.\\nMahajan, C. J., with whom Mukherjea, Vivian Bose and  Ghulam\\nHasan,  JJ., concurred, expressed his views at pages 651  to\\nreserved  his  opinion  on the  question.   The  view  which\\nVenkatarama   Aiyar,   J.,  expressed  was  this:   if   the\\nconstitutional  provision which has been  infringed  affects\\nthe competence of the legislature which passed the law,  the\\nlaw is a nullity; as for example, when a State enacts a  law\\nwhich is within the exclusive competence of the Union; when,\\nhowever,  a law is within the competence of the  legislature\\nwhich passed it and the unconstitutionality arises by reason\\nof  its repugnancy to provisions enacted for the benefit  of\\nindividuals,   it   is  not  a  nullity,   but   is   merely\\nunenforceable; such unconstitutionality can be waived and in\\nthat  case  the law becomes enforceable.  He  said  that  in\\nAmerica  this principle was well settled and he referred  to\\nCooley on Constitutional Limitations, Volume 1, pages 368 to\\n(1)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 613, 653, 654.\\npages 524, 531, 542 and 558; Rottschaefer on  Constitutional\\nLaw  at  pages 28 and 29-30.  He then  referred  to  certain\\nAmerican decisions in support of his views and then said:-\\n\\\" The position must be the same under our Constitution  when\\na law contravenes a prescription intended for the benefit of\\nindividuals............  It  is  open to  any  person  whose\\nrights  have  been infringed to waive it and when  there  is\\nwaiver,  there is no legal impediment to the enforcement  of\\nthe law.  It will be otherwise if the statute was a nullity;\\nin  which  case it can neither be waived nor  enforced.   If\\nthen  the  law is merely unenforceable and can  take  effect\\nwhen waived, it cannot be treated as non est and as effaced\\nout of the statute book.\\\"\\nThe  contrary view expressed by Mahajan, C. J., can be  best\\nexplained in his own words:\\n\\\"  We  think  that  it is not  a  correct  proposition  that\\nconstitutional  provisions in Part III of  our  Constitution\\nmerely  operate  as a check on the exercise  of  legislative\\npower.   It is axiomatic that when the lawmaking power of  a\\nState  is restricted by a written fundamental law, then  any\\nlaw  enacted and opposed to fundamental law is in excess  of\\nthe legislative authority and is thus a nullity.  Both these\\ndeclarations  of unconstitutionality go to the root  of  the\\npower itself and there is no real distinction between  them.\\nThey represent but two aspects of want of legislative power.\\nThe  legislative  power  of the  Parliament  and  the  State\\nlegislatures  as  conferred  by Arts. 245  and  246  of  the\\nConstitution  stands  curtailed by  the  fundamental  rights\\nchapter of the Constitution.  \\\"\\nHis  Lordship then referred to Art. 13 of  the  Constitution\\nand said that it was a clear and unequivocal mandate of  the\\nfundamental  law prohibiting the State from making any  laws\\nwhich came into conflict with Part III of the  Constitution.\\nHis Lordship added:\\n\\\" In our opinion the doctrine of, waiver enunciated by  some\\nAmerican  Judges  in construing  the  American  Constitution\\ncannot  be introduced in our Constitution without  a  fuller\\ndiscussion of the matter......... Without finally expressing\\nan opinion on this question, we\\nare  not for the moment convinced that this theory  has  any\\nrelevancy in construing the fundamental rights conferred  by\\nPart  III  of the Constitution.  We think  that  the  rights\\ndescribed as fundamental rights are a necessary  consequence\\nof the declaration in the ,preamble that the people of India\\nhave solemnly resolved to constitute India into a  sovereign\\ndemocratic  republic  and  to secure  to  all  its  citizens\\njustice, social, economic and political; liberty of thought,\\nexpression,  belief, faith and worship; equality  of  status\\nand of opportunity.  These fundamental rights have not  been\\nput  in  the  Constitution merely  for  individual  benefit,\\nthough  ultimately they come into operation  in  considering\\nindividual rights.  They have been put there as a matter  of\\npublic  policy  and  the doctrine of  waiver  can,  have  no\\napplication to provisions of law which have been enacted  as\\na matter of constitutional policy.\\\"\\nIt would appear that the two main reasons which Mahajan,  C.\\nJ.,  gave  in  support of the views expressed  by  him  were\\nthese.   Firstly, he held that the effect of Art. 13 of  the\\nConstitution was to prohibit the State from making any  laws\\nwhich  came into conflict with Part III of the  Constitution\\nand  he  recognised  no such distinction  as  was  drawn  by\\nVenkatarama Aiyar, J., between absence of legislative  power\\n(that   is,  incompetence  of  the  legislature)  and   non-\\nobservance of provisions which operate merely as a check  on\\nthe exercise of legislative power.  He thought that  absence\\nof  legislative  power and check on the exercise  of  legis-\\nlative power were both aspects of want of legislative power.\\nSecondly, he referred to the preamble and the scheme of Part\\nIII  of  the Constitution in support of his  view  that  the\\ndoctrine  of  waiver  did not  apply.   I  shall  take-these\\nreasons in the order in which I have stated them.\\nFirst,  as  to the effect of Art. 13  of  the  Constitution.\\nArticle 13 is in two parts: the first part deals with \\\"  all\\nlaws  in force in the territory of India immediately  before\\nthe commencement of this Constitution \\\"\\u2019and says that so far\\nas  such laws are inconsistent with the provisions  of  Part\\nIII, they shall to the extent of such\\ninconsistency be void; the second part deals with laws  made\\nafter  the commencement of the Constitution and says that  \\\"\\nthe  State  shall  not make any law  which  takes.  away  or\\nabridges  the  rights  conferred  by  Part  III  \\\"  of   the\\nConstitution and any law made in contravention of cl. (2) of\\nArt.  13 shall to the extent of  the contravention  be void.\\nIt seems clear to me that the Article itself recognises  the\\ndistinction between absence of legislative power which  will\\nmake the law made by an incompetent legislature wholly void,\\nand  exercise  of legislative power in  contravention  of  a\\nrestriction or check on such power, which will make the  law\\nvoid  to the extent of the inconsistency  or  contravention.\\nThe use, of the words \\\" to the extent of the inconsistency \\\"\\nand  \\\"  to  the extent of the  contravention  \\\"  indubitably\\npoints  to such a distinction, and indeed this  was  pointed\\nout in Bhikaji Narain Dhakras v. The State of Madhya Pradesh\\n(1).   This  was  an unanimous decision of  this  Court  and\\nseveral earlier decisions including the decision in  Kesavan\\nMadhava Menon\\u2019s case (2), on which Mahajan, C. J., placed so\\nmuch  reliance,  were considered therein.  The  decision  in\\nBehram  Khurshed Pesikaka (3)was also considered,  and  then\\nthe following observations were made with regard to Art.  13\\nof the Constitution at p. 598-\\n\\\" Article 13(1) by reason of its language cannot be read  as\\nhaving obliterated the entire operation of the  inconsistent\\nlaw or having wiped it out altogether from the statute book.\\nSuch   law  existed  for  all  past  transactions  and   for\\nenforcement  of  rights and liabilities accrued  before  the\\ndate  of the Constitution, as was held in  Keshavan  Madhava\\nMenon\\u2019s  case.   The law continued in force even  after  the\\ncommencement  of the Constitution, with respect  to  persons\\nwho  were not citizens and could not claim  the  fundamental\\nright.  In short, Art. 13(1) had the effect of nullifying or\\nrendering  the  existing law which had  become  inconsistent\\nwith  Art.  19(1)(g)  read with el. (6)  as  it  then  stood\\nineffectual, nugatory and devoid of any legal\\n(1) [1055] 2 S.C.R. 589-           (2) [1951] S.C.R. 228.\\n(3)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 613,653. 654.\\nforce  or binding effect only in respect of the exercise  of\\nthe   fundamental  right  on  or  after  the  date  of   the\\ncommencement    of    the    Constitution............    All\\nlaws,existing  or  future, which are inconsistent  with  the\\nprovisions  of  Part  III of our Constitution  are,  by  the\\nexpress provision of Art. 13, rendered void I to the  extent\\nof  such  inconsistency\\u2019.  Such laws were not dead  for  all\\npurposes.\\\"\\nThe  aforesaid view expressed in Bhikaji Narain\\u2019s  case  (1)\\nwas accepted in many later decisions including the  decision\\nin  Muthia\\u2019s  case  (2).  The  same  distinction  was  again\\nreferred  to in another unanimous decision of this Court  in\\nThe State of Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala (3) where at p.\\nThe  Court of Appeal has rightly pointed out that  when  the\\nvalidity  of an Act is called in question, the  first  thing\\nfor  the court to do is to examine whether the Act is a  law\\nwith   respect  to  a  topic  assigned  to  the   particular\\nLegislature  which enacted it. if it is, then the  court  is\\nnext  to consider whether, in the case of an Act  passed  by\\nthe  Legislature of a Province now a State),  its  operation\\nextends beyond the boundaries of the Province or the  State,\\nfor under the provisions conferring legislative powers on it\\nsuch Legislature can only make a law for its territories  or\\nany  part thereof and its laws cannot, in the absence  of  a\\nterritorial nexus, have any extra territorial operation.  If\\nthe  impugned law satisfies both these tests,  then  finally\\nthe court has to ascertain if there is anything in any other\\npart  of  the Constitution which places \\u02dcany fetter  on  the\\nlegislative  powers of such Legislature.  The  impugned  law\\nhas to pass all these three test.\\\"\\nTherefore,  the mere use of the word \\u02dc(6 void \\\" in  Art.  13\\ndoes not necessarily militate against the application of the\\ndoctrine of waiver in respect of the provisions contained in\\nPart   III   of  our  Constitution.   Under   the   American\\nConstitution   also,   a  law  made  in   violation   of   a\\nconstitutional guarantee is struck down, because under  Art.\\nVI of that Constitution, \\\" the Constitution and the laws  of\\nthe United States which\\n(1) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 589.        (2) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247.\\n(3)  [1957]  S.C.R. 874.\\nshall  be made in -pursuance thereof......... shall  be  the\\nsupreme law of the land.\\\" I am unable, therefore, to  accept\\nthe view that Art. 13 shows that the doctrine of waiver  can\\nnever be applied in respect of the provisions in Part III of\\nthe Constitution.\\nLet  me now go to the second reason. Is there any  thing  in\\nthe  preamble  and  the scheme  of  our  Constitution,  with\\nparticular  reference  to  Part III,  which  will  make  the\\ndoctrine of waiver inapplicable ? Let me first place the two\\npreambles side by side:\\n     Premple to our             Premple to the American\\n      Constitution.                Constitution,1787.\\n  \\\"We the people of India     \\\"We the people of the United\\nhaving solemny resolved to     States, in order to form a\\nconstitute India into a so-    more perfect Union,establish\\nvereign democratic republic    justice,insure domestic tra-\\nand to secure to all its ci-   nquillity,provide for the\\ntizens:justice,social,ecc-     common defence,promote the\\nnomic and political; liber-    general welfare,and secure\\nty of though,expression,       the blessing of liberty to\\nbelief,faith and worship;      ourselves and our posterity\\nequality of status and of      do ordain and establish\\nopportunity;and to promote     this Constitution for the\\namong them all fraternity      United State of America.\\\"\\nassuring the dignity of the\\nindividual and the unity of\\nthe nation;in our Constitu-\\nent Assemply this twenty-\\nsixth day of November,1949\\ndo hereby adopt,enact and\\ngive to ourselves this Co-\\nnstitution.\\\"\\nAmerican  Constitution  were : (a) to form  a  more  perfect\\nUnion;  (b)  to establish justice; (c)  to  insure  domestic\\ntranquillity;  (d)  to promote general welfare; and  (e)  to\\nsecure  the blessings of liberty.  In our Constitution,  the\\nemphasis  is  on  the Welfare  State-on   Justice,  Liberty,\\nEquality and Fraternity.  But the question before us is  the\\nlimited  question  of  the application of  the  doctrine  of\\nwaiver.  I do not find any. thing in the two preambles which\\nwill  make  the  doctrine applicable in  one  case  and  not\\napplicable in the other.\\nIt  is necessary to refer here to one important  distinction\\nbetween  the  two  Constitutions.   Speaking  broadly,   the\\nAmerican  Constitution  of  1787, except  for  defining  the\\nenumerated powers of the Federal Government and limiting the\\npowers  of  the  States, was an outline  of  government  and\\nnothing  more.   Its  provisions  were  written  in  general\\nlanguage  and  did  not  provide  minute  specifications  of\\nOrganisation   or   power.    It   contemplated   subsequent\\nlegislation  and interpretation for carrying the  provisions\\ninto  effect.  In other words, it was early recognised  that\\nthe   Constitution  was  not  self-executing.   The   Indian\\nConstitution  is  more  detailed, and in  Part  III  of  the\\nConstitution  are  provisions which not  merely  define  the\\nrights  but  also state to what extent they are  subject  to\\nrestrictions  in the interests of general welfare, etc.   In\\nother words, there is an attempt at adjustment of individual\\nrights  with social good, and in that sense the  limitations\\nor  restrictions are also defined.  But I do not think  that\\nthis distinction has any particular bearing on the  question\\nat issue before us.  The rights as also the restrictions are\\njusticiable,  and an interpretation of the rights given  and\\nof   the  restrictions  imposed,  by  courts  of   competent\\njurisdiction is contemplated.\\nIndeed,  I recognise that there is a  constitutional  policy\\nbehind   the   provisions  enacted  in  Part  III   of   the\\nConstitution.  In a, sense, there is a legislative policy in\\nall  statutory  enactments.   In  my  opinion,  the  crucial\\nquestion  is  not  whether  there  is  a  constitutional  or\\nlegislative  policy behind a particular provision,  but  the\\nquestion is-is the provision meant\\n                    597\\nprimarily  for the benefit of individuals or is it  for  the\\nbenefit  of  the general public ? That  distinction  has,  I\\nthink, been recognised in more than one decision.  Take, for\\nexample,  an ordinary statutory enactment like s. 80 of  the\\nCode  of  Civil Procedure which says that no suit  shall  be\\ninstituted  against  the  Government  or  against  a  public\\nofficer in respect of any act purporting to be done by  such\\npublic officer in his official capacity until the expiration\\nof two months next after a notice in writing has been given,\\netc.  There is undoubtedly a reason of public policy  behind\\nthis  provision,  but  it is open to  the  party  for  whose\\nbenefit the vision has been made to waive notice and  indeed\\nthe  party may be estopped by his conduct from pleading  the\\nwant  of  notice.  As the Privy Council pointed out  in  AL.\\nAR.   Villavar  Chettiar v. Government of  the  Province  of\\nMadras   (1),   there  is  no  inconsistency   between   the\\npropositions that the provisions of a section are  mandatory\\nand  must  be  enforced by the court and that  they  may  be\\nwaived by the authority for whose benefit they are provided.\\nThe question then is-is there anything in the statute  which\\nmilitates against the application of the doctrine of  waiver\\nto  such  right, subject to the safeguards  and  precautions\\nnecessary for the application of the doctrine, provided  the\\nright is for the benefit of individuals ?\\nI  am  conscious that rights which the  Constitution  itself\\ncharacterises as fundamental must be treated as such and  it\\nwill  be wrong to whittle them down.  But are  we  whittling\\ndown  fundamental  rights when we say that the  question  of\\nwaiver  of  fundamental  rights cannot be  answered  in  the\\nabstract-by a general affirmative or a general negative; the\\nquestion  must always depend on (a) the nature of the  right\\nguaranteed and (b) the foundation on the basis of which  the\\nplea  of waiver is raised.  It is to be remembered that  the\\nrights  guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution  are  not\\nconfined  to  citizens  alone.   Some  of  the  rights   are\\nguaranteed to non-citizens also.  Moreover, they are not all\\nrights   relating   to  justice,   liberty,   equality   and\\nfraternity; some of the provisions define the rights\\n(A)  (1947) L.R. 74 I.A. 223, 228.\\nwhile others indicate the restrictions or checks subject  to\\nwhich the rights are granted.  Article 33, for example, does\\nnot  give any right to any person; on the contrary it  gives\\npower  to Parliament to modify the rights conferred by  Part\\nIII in their application to persons.  Article 34 lays down a\\nconferred by Part III while in any area.  It is not,  there-\\nfore,  quite correct to say that all the provisions in  Part\\nIII  grant  fun  amental  rights,  though  the  heading   is\\n\\u2019Fundamental Rights\\u2019.\\nThere is, I think, a three-fold classification: (1) a  right\\ngranted  by  an ordinary statutory enactment;  (2)  a  right\\ngranted by. the Constitution; and (3) a right guaranteed  by\\nPart  III of the Constitution.  With regard to  an  ordinary\\nstatutory  right  there is, I think, no difficulty.   It  is\\nwell  recognised  that a statutory right which  is  for  the\\nbenefit  of  an individual can in  proper  circumstances  be\\nwaived by the party for whose benefit the provision has been\\nmade.   With  regard to a constitutional right,  it  may  be\\npointed  out  that  there  are  several  provisions  in  our\\nConstitution  which do not occur in Part III, but which  yet\\nrelate  to  certain rights; take, for  example,  the  rights\\nrelating  to the Services under the Union and the States  in\\nPart XIV.  I do not think that it can be seriously contended\\nthat  a right which is granted to a Government  servant  for\\nhis benefit cannot be waived by him, provided no question of\\njurisdiction is involved.  I may refer in this connection to\\nthe provisions in Part XIII which relate to trade,  commerce\\nand  intercourse  within  the  territory  of  India.   These\\nprovisions   also   impose  certain  restrictions   on   the\\nlegislative  powers  of  the Union and of  the  States  with\\nregard  to trade and commerce.  As these provisions are  for\\nthe benefit of the general public and not for any particular\\nindividual, they can not be waived, even though they do  not\\nfind place in Part III of the Constitution.  Therefore,  the\\ncrucial  question is not whether the rights or  restrictions\\noccur in one part or other of the Constitution.  The crucial\\nquestion  is  the nature of the right given: is it  for  the\\nbenefit of individuals or is it for the general public?\\nThat,  in  my opinion, is the true test.  I may  here  state\\nthat  the source of the right-contractual or statutory  --is\\nnot  the  determining  factor.  The doctrine  of  waiver  is\\ngrounded  on  the  principle  that  a  right,  statutory  or\\notherwise, which is for the benefit of an individual can  be\\nwaived  by  him.  I am aware that a right which is  for  the\\nbenefit  of the general public must in its actual  operation\\nrelate to particular individuals, in the same way as a right\\nfor the benefit of individuals will in its actual  operation\\narise  in connection with individual A or individual B.  The\\ntest  is  not  whether in its operation  it  relates  to  an\\nindividual.   The test is -for whose benefit the  right  has\\nbeen primarily granted for the benefit of the general public\\nor for individuals ?\\nLet me now apply this test to some of the provisions in Part\\nIII  of  the  Constitution.   These  provisions  have   been\\nclassified under different heads: (1) right to equality, (2)\\nright to freedom, (3) right against exploitation, (4)  right\\nto freedom of religion, (5) cultural and educational rights,\\n(6)  right  to  property and  (7)  right  to  constitutional\\nremedies.   There can be no doubt that some of these  rights\\nare  for  the  benefit of the  general  public.   Take,  for\\nexample,  Art. 23 which prohibits traffic in  human  beings,\\netc  ; so also Art. 24 \\u2019which says that no child  below  the\\nage  of 14 shall be employed to work in any factory or  mine\\nor engaged in any other hazardous employment.  I do not wish\\nto  multiply  examples and it is sufficient  to  state  that\\nseveral of these rights are rights which are meant primarily\\nfor  the  benefit  of  the general public  and  not  for  an\\nindividual.   But can we say the same thing in  -respect  of\\nall  the  rights ? Let us take Art. 31, which says  that  no\\nperson  shall be deprived of his property save by  authority\\nof  law and that no property shall be compulsorily  acquired\\nor  requisitioned  save  for a public purpose  and  save  by\\nauthority of law which provides for compensation, etc.  Take\\na case where a man\\u2019s property is acquired under a law  which\\ndoes  not  fix  the amount of compensation  or  specify  the\\nprinciples on which or the manner in which the  compensation\\nis to be determined and given.  The man whose\\nproperty  is taken may raise no objection to the  taking  of\\nhis property under such law.  Indeed, he may expressly agree\\nto Government taking his land for a public purpose under the\\nlaw  in  question,  though  it  does  not  comply  with  the\\nrequirements  as to compensation.  Can such a man after  two\\nor  three  years  change his mind and say that  the  law  is\\ninvalid  and  his land on which a school or a  hospital  may\\nhave  been built in the meantime should be restored to  him,\\nbecause  he could not waive his fundamental right ?   In  my\\nopinion,  if  we express the view in the  abstract  that  no\\nfundamental  right  can ever be waived, many  startling  and\\nunforeseen  results  may  follow.   Take  another   example.\\nSuppose  a man obtains a permit or a licence for  running  a\\nmotor vehicle or an excise shop.  Having enjoyed the benefit\\nof  the permit for several years, is it open to him  to  say\\nwhen action is proposed to be taken against him to terminate\\nthe licence, that the law under which the permit was granted\\nto  him was not constitutionally valid ? Having derived  all\\nthe  benefit from the permit granted to him, is it  open  to\\nhim  to  say  that the very Act under  which  a  permit  was\\ngranted  to  him  is  not valid in  law  ?  Such  and  other\\nstartling results will follow if we decide in the  abstract,\\nby a general negative, that a fundamental right can never be\\nwaived.  Take Art. 32, which is a right to a  constitutional\\nremedy,  namely,  the  right to move the  Supreme  Court  by\\nappropriate  proceedings for the enforcement of  the  rights\\nconferred  by Part III.  It is now well settled  by  several\\ndecisions  of  this court that the right under  Art.  32  is\\nitself a fundamental right.  Suppose a person exercises that\\nright and initiates appropriate proceedings for  enforcement\\nof  a  fundamental right\\u2019 Later he thinks better of  it  and\\nwithdraws his application.  Still later he changes his mind.\\nCan he then say that he could not waive his right under Art.\\nhad  no legal validity ? We may take still another  example.\\nUnder  Art.  30(1)  of  the  Constitution,  all  minorities,\\nwhether  based  on religion or language, have the  right  to\\nestablish and administer educational institutions of\\ntheir  choice.   Suppose, there is  a  minority  educational\\ninstitution  and  the minority has the right  to  administer\\nthat institution, but they want grant from Government.   The\\nminority  may  have  to  surrender  part  of  its  right  of\\nadministration  in  order to get Government  aid.   Can  the\\nminority  waive  its  right?   Such  a  question  arose  for\\nconsideration  in  the  advisory opinion which  we  gave  in\\nconnection with the Kerala Education Bill and-, so far as  I\\nhave  been able to understand, the effect of our opinion  is\\nthat  the  minority  can  surrender part  of  its  right  of\\nadministration of a school of its own choice in order to get\\naid  from Government.  If we now hold that the minority  can\\nnever  surrender its right, then the result will be that  it\\nwill never be able to ask for Government aid.\\nI  do  not  see  any  such  vital  distinction  between  the\\nprovisions  of  the American Constitution and those  of  our\\nConstitution  as  would lead me to the conclusion  that  the\\ndoctrine  of  waiver applies in  respect  of  constitutional\\nrights guaranteed by the American Constitution but will  not\\napply  in  respect of fundamental rights guaranteed  by  the\\nIndian Constitution.  Speaking generally, the prohibition in\\nPart  III  is against the State from taking  any  action  in\\nviolation of a fundamental right.  The word \\u2019State\\u2019 in  that\\nPart includes the Government and Parliament of India as also\\nthe  Government  and Legislature of each of the  States  and\\nalso all local or other authorities within the territory  of\\nIndia or under the control of the Government of India.   The\\nAmerican  Constitution also says the same thing  in  effect.\\nBy Art.  VI it states that the Constitution and the laws  of\\nthe  United States which shall be made in pursuance  thereof\\nshall be the supreme law of the land.  It is well settled in\\nAmerica  that the first ten amendments to the original  Con-\\nstitution  were substantially contemporaneous and should  be\\nconstrued  in pari materia.  In many of the  amendments  the\\nphraseology  used  is  similar to  the  phraseology  of  the\\nprovisions of Part III of our Constitution.\\nThe position under the American Constitution is\\nwell settled and a succinct statement of that position  will\\nbe  found in Rottschaefer on Constitutional Law, pp.  28-29.\\nThe learned author has summarised the position thus:\\n\\\"  There are certain constitutional provisions that  may  be\\nwaived  by  the  person  for  whose  protection  they   were\\nintended.   A  person who has waived that  protection  in  a\\ngiven instance may not thereafter. raise the issue that his,\\nconstitutional rights have been infringed in that  instance,\\nsince  whatever  injury he may incur is due to his  own  act\\nrather  than  to  the  enforcement  of  an  unconstitutional\\nmeasure against him.\\nA  person  who  would  otherwise  be  entitled  to  raise  a\\nconstitutional issue is sometimes denied that right  because\\nhe  is  estopped to do so.  The factor  usually  present  in\\nthese  cases  is  conduct  inconsistent  with  file  present\\nassertion  of that right, or conduct of such character  that\\nit  would  be  unjust  to others  to  permit  him  to  avoid\\nliability  on  constitutional  grounds.  A  person  may  not\\nquestion  the  constitutionality of the  very  provision  on\\nwhich  he bases the right claimed to be  infringed  thereby,\\nnor  of  a  provision  that  is  an  integral  part  in  its\\nestablishment  or definition.  The acceptance of  a  benefit\\nunder one provision of an Act does not ordinarily preclude a\\nperson  from  asserting\\u2019  the  invalidity  of  another   and\\nseverable  provision  thereof, but there are  exceptions  to\\nthis  rule.   The.\\u2019 promoters of a public  improvement  have\\nbeen  denied\\u2019 the right to contest the validity of the  rule\\napportioning its cost over the benefited lands, and a person\\nwho  has received the benefits of a statute may not  there-\\u2019\\nafter  assert its invalidity to defeat the claims of  those,\\nagainst  whom  it has been enforced in his  own  favour.   A\\nstate is estopped to claim that its own statute deprives it.\\nof  its  property  without due process of  law  but  it  is-\\npermitted to assert that its own statute invades rights that\\nits  constitution  confers  upon  it.   Prior   inconsistent\\nconduct  will not,however preclude a person  from  asserting\\nthe, invalidity of an act if under all the circumstances its\\nassertion involves no\\nunfairness or injustice to those against whom it is raised.\\\"\\nThe   learned  Attorney  General  placed  reliance  on   the\\nfollowing decisions: (1) Pierce v. Somerset Railway (1); (2)\\nWall v. Parrot Silver and Copper Company (2); (3) Pierce Oil\\nCorporation v. Phoenix Refining Company (3) ; (4) Shepard v.\\nBarron(4)  ; (5) United States V. Murdock(5); (6) Patton  v.\\nUnited States (6) ; and (7) Adams v. United States (7).  The\\nposition  in America is so well settled that I think  it  is\\nunnecessary to examine the aforesaid decisions in detail.  I\\nneed  only refer to the observations of Frankfurter, J.,  in\\nWilliam A. Adam\\u2019s case (supra).  The observations were  made\\nin  connection with a case where a trial was held without  a\\njury  at the request of the accused person himself in  spite\\nof the guarantee of Amendment VI. The observations were-\\n\\\"  What was contrived as protections for the accused  should\\nnot be turned into fetters.  To assert as an absolute that a\\nlayman,  no  matter how wise or experienced he  may  be,  is\\nincompetent to choose between judge and jury as the tribunal\\nfor  determining  his guilt or innocence, simply  because  a\\nlawyer  has not advised him on the choice, is  to  dogmatize\\nbeyond the bounds of learning or experience.\\\"\\nI have not been able to find any real reason on the basis of\\nwhich the decisions given above with regard to the  American\\nConstitution can be held to be inapplicable to similar cases\\narising under the Indian Constitution.\\nTwo subsidiary reasons have been given for holding that  the\\nposition under the Indian Constitution is different.  One is\\nthat  ours  is  a  nascent  democracy  and,  therefore,  the\\ndoctrine  of  waiver should not apply.  With respect,  I  am\\nunable to concur in this view.  I do not think that we shall\\nbe  advancing  the  cause  of  democracy  by  converting   a\\nfundamental  right into a fetter or using it as a means  for\\ngetting out of an\\n(1)  (1898) 171 U.S. 641.\\n(2)  (1917) 244.U.S.407.\\n(3)  (1922) 259.U.S.125.\\n(4)  (1904) 194.U.S.553.\\n(5)  (1931) 284.U.S.141.\\n(6)  (1930) 281.U.S.276.\\n(7)  (1942) 317.U.S.269.\\nagreement freely entered into by the parties.  I  appreciate\\nthat  waiver  is not to be light heartedly  applied,  and  I\\nagree that it must be applied with the fullest rigour of all\\nnecessary safeguards and cautions.  What I seriously  object\\nto  is  a statement in the abstract and \\\"in  absolute  terms\\nthat  in  no circumstances can a right given by any  of  the\\nprovisions  in  Part  III of  the  Constitution  be  waived.\\nAnother  point  taken  is that the provisions  in  Part  III\\nembody what are called  natural rights\\u2019 and such rights have\\nbeen  retained  by the people and can  never  be  interfered\\nwith.   I  am unable to acquiesce in this.   The  expression\\nnatural  rights\\u2019  is in itself somewhat  vague.   Sometimes,\\nrights  have  been divided into  natural rights\\u2019  and  civil\\nrights\\u2019,  and  natural rights\\u2019 have been stated to be  those\\nwhich are necessarily inherent or innate and which come from\\nthe very elementary laws of nature whereas civil rights  are\\nthose  which arise from the needs of civil as  distinguished\\nfrom  barbaric communities.  I am unable, however, to  agree\\nthat any such distinction is apparent from the provisions in\\nPart  III  of our Constitution: all the rights  referred  to\\ntherein appear to be created by the Constitution.  I do  not\\nthink  that Locke\\u2019s doctrine of natural rights\\u2019,  which  was\\nperhaps  the  authority  for  the  American  Declaration  of\\nIndependence,  played  any  part in  the  enactment  of  the\\nprovisions  of Part III of our Constitution.   The  doctrine\\nwhich  has long since ceased to receive general  acceptance,\\nhas  been thus explained by E. W. Paterson (see Natural  Law\\nand  Natural  Rights, Southern Methodist  University  Press,\\nDallas, 1955, p. 61):\\n\\\" The theory of natural rights, for which we are indebted to\\nthe seventeenth-century English philosopher, John Locke,  is\\nessentially different from the theories of natural law  just\\ndiscussed   in   that   it   lacked   the   two    important\\ncharacteristics   above  -mentioned:  the  concept   of   an\\nimmutable   physical  order  and  the  concept   of   divine\\nreason............ He begins with the purpose of  justifying\\nthe  existence of a government with coercive  powers.   What\\ninconveniences would arise if there were no government?  Men\\nwould live in a \\\" stage of nature\\u2019; to avoid confusion  with\\nthe\\n                    605\\npolitical  state I shall call this a  condition of  nature\\u2019.\\nIn such a condition man would be free to work, to enjoy  the\\nfruits  of his labour, and to barter with others;  he  would\\nalso  be free to enforce the law of nature  (whose  precepts\\nLocke did not define) against every other man.  Since  Locke\\nwas an optimist about human nature he thought men would  get\\nalong  pretty  well  in this  lawless  condition.   Yet  the\\ncondition  of  nature  is  for  Locke  a  fiction  like  the\\nassumption  of  a frictionless machine  in  mechanics.   The\\nchief disadvantages that men in this condition would  suffer\\nwere,  he thought, the absence of an established  law,,  the\\nabsence  of  a  known and  impartial  magistrate  to  settle\\ndisputes, the absence of a. power sufficient to execute  and\\nenforce  the  judgment of the magistrate.   Moved  by  these\\ninconveniences,  men would enter into a social compact  with\\neach  other whereby each would transfer to a  third  person,\\nthe government, such rights over his person and property  as\\nthe   government  must  have  in  order  to   remove   these\\ninconveniences.    All   other   rights,   privileges,   and\\nimmunities he reserved, as a grantor of land conveys the fee\\nsimple  to  his son and reserves a life estate  to  himself.\\nThese reserved rights were  natural\\u2019 rights because they had\\noriginated  in  the  condition of nature  and  survived  the\\nsocial compact.\\\"\\nThere  are, in my opinion, clear indications in Part III  of\\nthe  Constitution  itself  that the doctrine  of  \\u2019  natural\\nrights\\u2019  had  played  no  part in  the  formulation  of  the\\nprovisions  therein.   Take Arts. 33, 34 and 35  which  give\\nParliament power to modify the rights conferred by Part III.\\nIf they were natural rights, the Constitution could not have\\ngiven  power to Parliament to modify them.  Therefore, I  am\\nof  the view that the doctrine of \\u2019natural  rights\\u2019  affords\\nnothing but a foundation of shifting sand for building up  a\\nthesis  that  the doctrine of waiver does not apply  to  the\\nrights guaranteed in Part III of our Constitution.\\nThe true position as I conceive it is this: where a right or\\nprivilege  guaranteed  by  the  Constitution  rests  in  the\\nindividual  and  is primarily intended for his  benefit  and\\ndoes not impinge on the right of others, it\\ncan  be waived provided such waiver is not forbidden by  law\\nand does not contravene public. policy or public morals.\\nIn  the  case  before  us, I have  held  that  there  is  no\\nfoundation   on  facts  to  sustain  the  plea  of   waiver.\\nTherefore,  I would allow the appeal with costs.  The  order\\nof the Commissioner of Income-tax, Delhi, dated January  29,\\nimplementation  of the order of the Union  Government  dated\\nJuly 5, 1954, must be quashed.\\nSUBBA  RAO,  J.-I  have had the advantage  of  perusing  the\\njudgments  of  my  Lord the Chief  Justice  and  my  learned\\nbrother, S. K. Das, J. I agree with their conclusion, but  I\\nwould  prefer to express my opinion separately in regard  to\\nthe question of the applicability of the doctrine of  waiver\\nto the fundamental rights.\\nThis  case  raises a most serious  and  important  question,\\nviz.,  whether  the  doctrine  of  waiver  operates  on  the\\nfundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, a question\\nnot  confined to the immediate purpose of  this  litigation,\\nbut  to  the public in general.  The question  is  bound  to\\narise  frequently,  and  the  varying  observations  already\\nexpressed  by  the learned Judges of this Court  would  lend\\nscope   for  conflicting  decisions  involving  parties   in\\nunnecessary litigation and avoidable hardship.  The question\\nwas  directly  raised and fully argued before  us.   In  the\\ncircumstances,  I  cannot share the opinion  of  my  learned\\nbrother,  S.  K.  Das, J., that this Court  should  avoid  a\\ndecision  on this question and leave it to be decided  in  a\\nmore appropriate case.\\nThe  facts  have  been fully stated by  my  Lord  the  Chief\\nJustice in his judgment and I need not restate them.\\nThe learned Attorney General contended that in the  American\\nLaw the principle of waiver was applied to rights created by\\nthe Constitution except in cases where the protection of the\\nrights  was based upon public policy and that, by  the  same\\nanalogy,  if no public policy was involved, even  in  India,\\nthe person\\n                    607\\naffected by the infringement of the fundamental rights could\\nwaive  the constitutional protection guaranteed to him.   It\\nwas  said that in the present case the appellant waived  his\\nfundamental  right under Art. 14 of the Constitution as  the\\nright  was  only in respect of his liability to tax  and  he\\ncould  legitimately waive it.  To, appreciate this  argument\\nit would be convenient at the outset to notice the  American\\nLaw  on  the subject.  Certain rights, which  are  sometimes\\ndescribed as the Bill of Rights, have been introduced by the\\nAmendment; to the Constitution of America.  They declare the\\nrights of the people of America in respect of the freedom of\\nreligion speech, press, assemblage and from illegal seizurs.\\nThey  guarantee trial by jury in certain criminal and  civil\\nmatters.   They give protection against  self-incrimination.\\nThe Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States\\nprescribes  that  no  person shall  be  deprived  of  life.,\\nliberty  or property without due process of law;  nor  shall\\nprivate  property  be  taken for  public  use  without  just\\ncompensation.  The Fourteenth Amendment of the  Constitution\\nintroduces  the rule of due process as a protection  against\\nthe  State  action.  The said amendments are intended  as  a\\nprotection  to citizens against the action of the Union  and\\nthe  States.  Though the rights so declared are general  and\\nwide in their terms, the Supreme Court of America, by a long\\ncourse  of -judicial, interpretation, having regard  to  the\\nsocial  conditions\\u2019  in that country, has given  content  to\\nthose  rights and imposed limitations thereon in an  attempt\\nto reconcile individual rights with social good, by evolving\\ncounterbalancing   doctrines   of  police   power,   eminent\\ndomain,,.  and  such  others.   During  the  course  of  the\\nevolution.  of  the  law, attempts were made  to  apply  the\\ndoctrine of waiver to the provisions of the Constitution  of\\nAmerica.   American Courts applied the doctrine  with  great\\ncaution  and  in  applying  the  same,  laid  down  definite\\nprinciples.\\nThe  said  principles  were  culled  out  from  the  various\\ndecisions and clearly summarized in the authoritative, text-\\nbooks on the Constitution of America under different heads:\\nWILLIS ON \\u2019CONSTITUTIONAL LAW\\u2019:\\nThe  privilege  against self-incrimination\\u2019  like-any  other\\nprivilege, is one which may be waived.\\nDouble  jeopardy is a privilege and may be waived  expressly\\nor impliedly.\\nThe  immunity is one which may be waived and by consent  one\\ncan make a search and seizure reasonable.\\nThe United States Supreme Court......... held that neither a\\njurisdictional  question nor the interest of the  State  was\\ninvolved,  but only the privilege and right of the  accused,\\nand that these were subject to waiver in accordance with the\\nusual rules.\\nIn  order to delimit personal liberty by  exercising  social\\ncontrol,  the branch of the government undertaking to do  so\\nmust  have jurisdiction.  If it does not have  jurisdiction,\\nit  is taking personal liberty (life, liberty  or  property)\\nwithout  due  process  of law.  To this rule  there  are  no\\nexceptions.  It cannot be waived.\\n\\u2019COOLEY\\u2019S CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS\\u2019:\\nWhere  a  constitutional  provision  is  designed  for,  the\\nprotection solely of the property rights of the. citizen, it\\nis competent for him to waive the protection, and to consent\\nto  such  action as would be invalid if  taken  against  his\\nwill.\\nIn  criminal  cases  the  doctrine  that  a   constitutional\\nprivilege  may  be  waived must be true to  a  very  limited\\nextent  only.   A  party may consent  to  waive  rights  of.\\nproperty, but the trial and punishment for. public  offences\\nare  not  within the provinces of individual  con.  sent  or\\nagreement.\\nCORPUS JURIS SECUNDUM:\\nIt  has  been  stated  supra (p. 1050,  note  32)  that  the\\ndoctrine of waiver extends to rights and privileges\\n                    609\\nof any character, and since the word \\u2019 waiver\\u2019 covers  every\\nconceivable right, it is the general rule that a person  may\\nwaive  any  matter  which  affects  his  property,  and  any\\nalienable  right  or privilege of which he is the  owner  or\\nwhich  belongs  to him or to which he is  legally  entitled,\\nwhether  secured  by  contract,  conferred  by  statute,  or\\nguaranteed   by  constitution,  provided  such  rights   and\\nprivileges  rest  in the individual, are intended  \\u2019for  his\\nsole  benefit, do not infringe on the rights of others,  and\\nfurther provided the waiver Of the right or privilege is not\\nforbidden by law, and does not contravene public policy, and\\nthe  principle  is recognized that everyone has a  right  to\\nwaive,  and agree to waive, the advantage of a law  or  rule\\nmade solely for the benefit and protection of the individual\\nin  his  private capacity, if it can be dispensed  with  and\\nrelinquished  without  infringing on any  public  right  and\\nwithout detriment to the community at large.........\\nAs  a general rule, rights relating to procedure and  remedy\\nare  subject to waiver, but if a right is so fundamental  in\\nits  nature  as  to  be regarded by  the  state  as  vitally\\nintegrated  in  immemorially established  processes  of  the\\nadministration of justice, it cannot be waived by anyone.\\nThe  cases  cited  at  the  Bar  illustrate  the   aforesaid\\nprinciples.   The  doctrine was applied to  the  obligations\\nunder  a  contract  in Pierce v. Somerset  Railway  (1);  to\\ndeprivation of property without due process of law in Pierce\\nOil  Corporation v. Phoenix Refining Company(2) and  Shepard\\nv.  Barron (3) to trial by jury in Patton v.  United  States\\n(4)     and   Adams  v.  United  States(5);  and   to   self-\\nincrimination in United States v. Murdock (6).  It is  true,\\nas the learned counsel for the appellant contended, that  in\\nsome  of  the aforesaid decisions, observations are  in  the\\nnature  of  obiter, but they clearly indicate the  trend  of\\njudicial opinion in America.\\n(1)  (1898) 43 L. Ed- 316; 171 U.S. 641.\\n(2)  (1922) 66 L.Ed. 855; 259 U.S. 125.\\n(3)  (1904) 48 L. Ed. 1115 ; 194 U. S. 553.\\n(4)  (1930) 74 L. Ed. 854; 281 U.S. 276.\\n(5)  (1942) 87 L. Ed. 268.\\n(6)  (1931) 76 L. Ed 210; 284 U.S. 141.\\nThe American Law on the subject may be summarized thus:  The\\ndoctrine of waiver can be invoked when the Constitutional or\\nStatutory  guarantee of a right is not conceived  in  public\\ninterest or when it does not affect the jurisdiction of  the\\nauthority  infringing the said right.  But if the  privilege\\nconferred or the right created by the statute is solely  for\\nthe benefit of the individual, he can waive it.  But even in\\nthose  cases  the Courts invariably administered  a  caution\\nthat  having regard to the nature of the right some  precau-\\ntionary  and stringent conditions should be  applied  before\\nthe doctrine is invoked or applied.\\nThis leads me to the question whether the fundamental rights\\nenshrined  in  the  Indian  Constitution  pertain  to   that\\ncategory  of  rights  which  could be  waived.   To  put  it\\ndifferently, whether the Constitutional guarantee in  regard\\nto   the   fundamental  rights  restricts   or   ousts   the\\njurisdiction   of   the  relevant  authorities   under   the\\nConstitution  to make laws in derogation of the said  rights\\nor  whether  the  said rights are for  the  benefit  of  the\\ngeneral public.  At the outset I would like to sound a  note\\nof  warning.   While it is true that the  judgments  of  the\\nSupreme Court of the United States are of a great assistance\\nto  this  Court  in elucidating and  solving  the  difficult\\nproblems  that  arise  from  time to  time,  it  is  equally\\nnecessary  to keep in mind the fact that the  decisions  are\\ngiven  in  the context of a different social,  economic  and\\npolitical  set  up,  and  therefore  great  care  should  be\\nbestowed  in  applying those decisions to cases  arising  in\\nIndia   with  different  social,  economic   and   political\\nconditions.   While  the principles evolved by  the  Supreme\\nCourt of the United States of America may in certain circum-\\nstances  be accepted, their application to similar facts  in\\nIndia  may  not  always lead to the  same  results.   It  is\\ntherefore   necessary   to  consider  the  nature   of   the\\nfundamental rights incorporated in the Indian  Constitution,\\nthe  conditions  of  the people for whose  benefit  and  the\\npurpose  for which they were created, and the effect of  the\\nlaws made in violation of those rights.  The Constitution of\\nIndia  in  its preamble promises to secure to  all  citizens\\njustice, social, economic and\\npolitical; liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and\\nworship;  equality  of  status and of  opportunity;  and  to\\npromote  among them all fraternity assuring the  dignity  of\\nthe  individual  and the unity of the nation.   One  of  the\\nthings  the  Constitution did to achieve the  object  is  to\\nincorporate  the  fundamental rights  in  the  Constitution.\\nThey  are  divided  into  seven  categories:  (i)  right  to\\nequality-Arts.  14 to 18; (ii) right to freedom-Arts. 19  to\\nright  to freedom of religion Arts. 25 to 28 ; (v)  cultural\\nand  educational  rightsArts.  29  and  30;  (vi)  right  to\\nproperty-Arts.  31,  31  A  and  31B;  and  (vii)  right  to\\nConstitutional  remediesArts. 32 to 35.   Patanjali  Sastri,\\nJ., as he then was, pointed out, in Gopalan v. The, State of\\nMadras(1), that fundamental rights contained in Part III  of\\nthe  Constitution are really rights that are still  reserved\\nto  the people after the delegation of rights by the  people\\nto the institutions of Government both at the Centre and  in\\nthe States created by the Constitution.  Article 13 reads :-\\n(1) All laws in force in the territory of India  immediately\\nbefore  the commencement of this Constitution, in so far  as\\nthey  are inconsistent with the pro. visions of  this  Part,\\nshall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void.\\n(2)  The  State shall not make any law which takes away  or,\\nabridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law  made\\nin contravention of this clause, shall, to the extent of the\\ncontravention, be void.\\\"\\nThis  Article,  in  clear and unambiguous  terms,  not  only\\ndeclares  that all laws in fore before the  commencement  of\\nthe   Constitution  and  made  thereafter  taking  away   or\\nabridging the said rights would be void to the extent of the\\ncontravention  but also prohibits the State from making  any\\nlaw  taking away or abridging the said rights.  Part III  is\\ntherefore  enacted  for the benefit of all the  citizens  of\\nIndia,  in an attempt to preserve to them their  fundamental\\nrights  against infringement by the institutions created  by\\nthe Constitution; for, without that safeguard, the objects\\n(1) [1950] S. C. R. 88.\\nadumbrated in the Constitution could not be-achieve,-].  For\\nthe  same purpose, the said chapter imposes a limitation  on\\nthe  power of the State to make laws in violation  of  those\\nrights.  The entire part, in my view, has been introduced in\\npublic  interest, and it is not proper that the  fundamental\\nrights   created  under  the  various  Articles  should   be\\ndissected to ascertain whether any or which part of them  is\\nconceived  in  public  interest and which part  of  them  is\\nconceived  for  individual benefit.  Part III  reflects  the\\nattempt  of the Constitution makers to reconcile  individual\\nfreedom  with State Control.  While in America this  process\\nof reconciliation was allowed to be evolved by the course of\\njudicial  decisions,  in India, the fundamental  rights  and\\ntheir  limitations  are  crystallized and  embodied  in  the\\nConstitution  itself; while in America a freehand was  given\\nto the judiciary not only to evolve the content of the right\\nbut  also its limitations, in the Indian Constitution  there\\nis  not  much scope for such a process.   The  Court  cannot\\ntherefore import any further limitations on the  fundamental\\nrights  other  than  those  contained in  Part  III  by  any\\ndoctrine,  such  as  \\\"  waiver \\\"  or  otherwise.   I  would,\\ntherefore, hold that the fundamental rights incorporated  in\\nPart III of the Constitution cannot be waived.\\nIt  is said. that such an inflexible rule would, in  certain\\ncases,  defeat  the very object for  which  the  fundamental\\nrights  are  created.   I  have  carefully  scrutinized  the\\nArticles in Part III of the Constitution of India, and  they\\ndo  not,  in my view, disclose any such  anomaly  or  create\\nunnecessary  hardship to\\u2019 the people for whose  benefit  the\\nrights  are  created.   Article,  14  embodies  the   famous\\nprinciple of equality before the law and equal protection of\\nthe  laws,  and  Arts. 15 to 18 and  Art.  29(2)  relate  to\\nparticular   applications  of  the  rule.    The   principle\\nunderlying   these  Articles  is  the  mainspring   of   our\\ndemocratic  form  of  government and it  guarantees  to  its\\ncitizens equal protection in respect of both substantive and\\nprocedural laws.  If the doctrine of waiver is engrafted  to\\nthe said fundamental principles, it will mean that a citizen\\ncan  agree  to  be discriminated.\\u2019  When  one  realizes  the\\nunequal\\n                    613\\npositions  occupied  by the State and the  private  citizen,\\nparticularly  in  India where illiteracy is rampant,  it  is\\neasy  to visualize that in a conflict between the State  and\\n-a  citizen,  the latter may, by fear of force  or  hope  of\\npreferment,  give up his right.  It is said that in  such  a\\ncase coercion or influence can be established in a Court  of\\nlaw,  but in practice it will be well nigh impossible to  do\\nso.  The same reasoning will apply to Arts. 15 and 16.  Art.\\nwaiver  in  its  impact on  the  fundamental  rights.   That\\nArticle in express terms forbids untouchability;  obviously,\\na   person  cannot  ask  the  State  to  treat  him  as   an\\nuntouchable.  Article 19 reads:-\\n\\\"(1) All citizens shall have the right-\\n(a)  to freedom of speech and expression;\\n(b)  to assemble peaceably and without arms;\\n(c)  to form associations or unions;\\n(d)  to move freely throughout the territory of\\nIndia ;\\n(e)to  reside  and settle in any part of  the  territory  of\\nIndia;\\n(f)  to acquire, hold and dispose of property ; and\\n(g)  to  practice  any  profession,  or  to  carry  on   any\\noccupation, trade or business.\\\"\\nThe right to freedom is the essential attribute of a citizen\\nunder democratic form of government.  The freedoms mentioned\\nin Art. 19 are subject to certain restrictions mentioned  in\\ncls.  (2)  to (6) of that Article.  So far as  the  freedoms\\nnarrated  in sub-cls. (a) to (g) of Cl. (1) of Art.  19  are\\nconcerned,  I  cannot  visualise  any  contingency  where  a\\ncitizen  would  be -in a worse position than he  was  if  he\\ncould  not  exercise  the right of  waiver.   In  regard  to\\nfreedom  to  acquire,  hold  and  dispose  of  property,   a\\nplausible  argument may be advanced, namely, that a  citizen\\nshould have a right to waive his right to acquire, hold  and\\ndispose  of property ; for, otherwise he might be  compelled\\nto  acquire  and hold his property, even if he  intended  to\\ngive it up  There is an underlying fallacy in this argument.\\nThe Article does not compel a citizen to acquire, hold and\\ndispose of property just as it does not compel a per. son to\\ndo  any  of the acts covered by the other freedoms.   If  he\\ndoes  not  want to reside in any part of  the  territory  of\\nIndia or to make a speech or to practise any profession,  he\\nis  at liberty not to do any of ,,these things.  So  too,  a\\nperson  may not acquire the property at all or practise  any\\nprofession  but if he seeks to acquire property or  practise\\nany  profession,  he cannot be told that he has  waived  his\\nright  at an earlier stage to acquire property  or  practise\\nthe  profession.  A freedom to do a particular act  involves\\nthe  freedom  not  to do that act.  There  is  an  essential\\ndistinction  between  the non-exercise of a  right  and  the\\nexercise  of a right subject to the doctrine of waiver.   So\\nunderstood, even in the case of the right covered by sub-cl.\\n(f) of cl. (1), there cannot be any occasion when a  citizen\\nwould  be worse off than when he had no  fundamental  rights\\nunder  the  Article.  The preservation of the  rights  under\\nArt.  19 without any further engrafting of  any  limitations\\nthan  those  already  imposed  under  the  Constitution,  is\\ncertainly  in the interest of the public ; for,  the  rights\\nare  essential for the development of human  personality  in\\nits diverse aspects.  Some comment is made in regard to  the\\nright covered by el. (3) of Art. 20, and it is asked that if\\na  person has no liberty to waive the protection under  that\\nclause, he could not give evidence even if he wanted to give\\nit  in his own interest.  This argument ignores the  content\\nof  the  right under cl. (3) of Art.  20.   The  fundamental\\nright of a person is only that he should not be compelled to\\nbe a witness against himself.  It would not prevent him from\\ngiving evidence voluntarily.  Under Art. 21, no person shall\\nbe deprived of his life or personal liberty except according\\nto procedure established by law and Art. 22 gives protection\\nagainst  arrest  and detention in certain cases.  I  do  not\\nthink  that  any situation can be conceived  when  a  person\\ncould  waive  this right to his  advantage.   Article  23(1)\\nprohibits traffic in human beings and forced labour.  It  is\\nnot  suggested that a person can waive  this  Constitutional\\nprotection.   So  too,  the  right  under  Art.  24,   which\\nprohibits employment\\nof children in factories, cannot be waived.  That apart,  so\\nfar as this Article is concerned, no question of waiver  can\\narise as a child cannot obviously waive his right under this\\nArticle.   Article 25 gives guarantee for religious  liberty\\nsubject  to  certain  restrictions  contained  therein.   It\\ndeclares  that all persons are  equally entitled  to freedom\\nof conscience and the right freely to profess, practise  and\\npropagate  religion.  This right is certainly  conceived  in\\nthe  public interest and cannot be waived.  So too,  freedom\\nto manage religious affairs, freedom as to payment Of  taxes\\nfor  promotion of any particular religion and freedom as  to\\nattendance at religious instruction or religious worship  in\\ncertain  educational  institutions  are  all  conceived   to\\nenforce the religious neutrality of the State and it  cannot\\nbe  suggested  that they are not in  public  interest.   The\\ncultural and educational rights of the minorities and  their\\nright  to establish and administer educational  institutions\\nof  their choice are given for the protection of the  rights\\nof the minorities and it cannot be said that they are not in\\npublic interest.  Article 31, which prohibits the State from\\ndepriving a person of his property save by authority of  law\\nor  to acquire any property without paying compensation,  is\\nintended to protect the properties of persons from arbitrary\\nactions  of  the State.  This Article is  conceived  in  the\\ninterest  of the public and a person cannot say that he  can\\nbe deprived of his property without authority of law or that\\nhis land can be acquired without compensation.\\nIt  is  suggested  that  if  a  person,  after  waiving  his\\nfundamental  right  to property and allowing  the  State  to\\nincur  heavy expenditure in improving the same, turns  round\\nand claims to recover the said property, the State would  be\\nput to irreparable injury.  Firstly, no such occasion should\\narise,  as the State is not expected to take  its  citizens\\u2019\\nproperty or deprive them of their property otherwise than by\\nauthority  of  law.  Secondly, if the owner  of  a  property\\nintends to give it to the State, the State can always insist\\nupon  conveying to it the said property in the manner  known\\nto law.  Thirdly, other remedies may be open to the\\nrecover   compensation  or  damages  for  the   improvements\\nbonafide  made  or the loss incurred, having regard  to  the\\ncircumstances  of a particular case.  These  considerations,\\nin my view, are of no relevance in considering the  question\\nof waiver in the context of fundamental rights.  By  express\\nprovisions of the Constitution, the State is prohibited from\\nmaking  any  law  which takes away or  abridges  the  rights\\nconferred  by  Part III of the Constitution.  The  State  is\\nnot,  therefore, expected to enforce any right  contrary  to\\nthe Constitutional prohibition on the ground that the  party\\nwaived his fundamental right.  If this prohibition is  borne\\nin  mind,  no occasion can arise when the\\u2019  State  would  be\\nprejudiced.   The prejudice, if any, to the State  would  be\\ncaused not by the non-application of the doctrine of  waiver\\nbut  by  its  own  action  contrary  to  the  Constitutional\\nprohibition imposed on it.\\nIt  is  then said that if the doctrine of waiver  is  to  be\\nexcluded, a person can apply to the Supreme Court under Art.\\nwithdraw  the petition, get the order of the  Supreme  Court\\ndismissing it and then apply over again for issue of a  writ\\nin respect of the same right.  The apprehension so expressed\\nis  more  imaginary  than real; for, it  has  no  foundation\\neither in fact or in law.  When an application is dismissed,\\nfor  whatever  reason  it may be-whether  on  merits  or  on\\nadmission-, the order of the Court becomes final and it  can\\nbe reopened only in the manner prescribed by law.  There  is\\nno  scope for the application of the doctrine of  waiver  in\\nsuch a cage.\\nArticles  33  and  34 contain  some  of  the  Constitutional\\nlimitations  on the application and the enforcement  of  the\\nfundamental  rights.  The former.  Article confers power  on\\nParliament to modify the rights conferred by Part III of the\\nConstitution  in their application to facts and  the  latter\\nenables  it to impose restrictions on the  rights  conferred\\nby\\u2019 that Part, while martial law is in force in any area.\\nThese  two  Articles, therefore, do not  create  fundamental\\nrights, but impose limitations thereon and I\\n                    617\\ncannot  appreciate the argument that their presence in  Part\\nIII  either  derogates from the content of  the  fundamental\\nrights  declared therein or sustains the doctrine of  waiver\\nin  its application to the said rights.  Article 35  confers\\non the Parliament, the power to legislate for giving  effect\\nto  the  provisions  of Part III  to  the  exclusion  of the\\nLegislatures  of  the, States.  This Article also  does  not\\ncreate  a  fundamental right, but provides a  machinery  for\\nenforcing that right.\\nA  startling  result, it is suggested, would flow  from  the\\nrejection  of the doctrine of waiver and the  suggestion  is\\nsought to be illustrated by the following example : A person\\ntakes a permit for several years from the State for  running\\na  motor  vehicle  or an excise shop.   Having  enjoyed  the\\nbenefit for several years and when action is proposed to  be\\ntaken against him to terminate the licence, he contends that\\nthe  law under which the permit was granted to him  offended\\nhis  fundamental rights and therefore  constitutionally  not\\nvalid.   It is asked whether it would be open to him to  say\\nthat the very Act under which the permit was granted to  him\\nwas  not valid in law.  To my mind, this  illustration  does\\nnot  give  rise to any anomaly.  Either a person can  run  a\\nmotor  vehicle  or an excise shop with  licence  or  without\\nlicence.  On the basis the law is valid, a licence is  taken\\nand the motor vehicle is run under that licence and if  that\\nlaw  offends  his fundamental right and therefore  void,  he\\ncontinues to ran the business without licence, as no licence\\nis  required under a valid law.  The aforesaid  illustration\\ndoes not, there. fore, give rise to any anomaly and even  if\\nit does, it does not affect the legal position.\\nI  have  considered the various provisions relating  to  the\\nfundamental  rights with a view to discover if there is  any\\njustification  for the comment that without the aid  of  the\\ndoctrine  of  waiver a citizen,  in  certain  circumstances,\\nwould  be  in a worse position than that he would be  if  he\\nexercised his right.  I have shown that there is none.   Nor\\nis  there any basis for the suggestion that the State  would\\nirreparably  suffer  under certain contingencies;  for,  any\\nresulting hardship would be its\\nown  making and could be avoided if it acted  in  accordance\\nwith law.\\nA  large  majority  of our  people  are  economically  poor,\\neducationally backward and politically not yet conscious  of\\ntheir  rights.   Individually  or  even  collectively,  they\\ncannot  be  pitted  against  the  State  organizations   and\\ninstitutions,  nor  can they meet them on equal  terms.   In\\nsuch circumstances, it is the duty of this Court to  protect\\ntheir  rights  against themselves.  I  have,  therefore,  no\\nhesitation in holding that the fundamental rights created by\\nthe Constitution are transcendental in nature, conceived and\\nenacted  in  national  and public  interest,  and  therefore\\ncannot be waived.\\nThat apart, I would go further and hold that as section 5(1)\\nof the Act XXX of 1947 was declared to be void by this Court\\nin M. Ct.  Muthiah v. The Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras\\n(1),  the  appellant  can. not, by the  application  of  the\\ndoctrine of waiver, validate the enquiry made under the said\\nAct.  It is suggested that there is a distinction between  a\\ncase   where  the  enactment  is  beyond   the   legislative\\ncompetence  Of  the Legislature which made it and  the  case\\nwhere the law is unconstitutional on the ground of existence\\nof  a  constitutional limitation, that while in  the  former\\ncase the law is null and void, in the latter case the law is\\nunenforceable  and  may  be revived by the  removal  of  the\\nlimitation  by  an amendment of the Constitution.   On  this\\ndistinction an argument is sought to be built to the  effect\\nthat  as in the present case s. 5(1) of the Act XXX of  1947\\nwas  declared to be invalid only on the ground that  it  was\\nhit  by Art. 14 of the Constitution, the law must be  deemed\\nto  be on the statute book and therefore the  appellant  was\\nwithin  his right to waive his constitutional guarantee.   I\\nam unable to appreciate this, argument.\\nThe  scope of Art. 13(1) of the Constitution was  considered\\nby  this  Court in Keshavan Madhava Menon v.  The  state  of\\nBombay  (2).  This Court by a majority held that Art.  13(1)\\nof the Constitution does not make\\n(1) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247.\\n(2) [1951] S.C.R. 228.\\nexisting  laws which are inconsistent with  the  fundamental\\nrights,   void  ab  initio,  but  only  renders  such   laws\\nunenforceable  and void with respect to the exercise of  the\\nfundamental rights on and after the date of commencement  of\\nthe  Constitution.  Mahajan, C. J., who was a party to  that\\ndecision,  explained  the word ,void\\u2019 in Art. 13(1)  of  the\\nConstitution in Behram Khurshed Pesikaka v. State of  Bombay\\n(1).  He observed at page 652 thus:-\\n\\\" It is axiomatic that when the law-making power of a  State\\nis  restricted  by  written fundamental law,  then  any  law\\nenacted  and opposed to the fundamental law is in excess  of\\nthe legislative authority and is thus a nullity.  Both these\\ndeclarations  of unconstitutionality go to the root  of  the\\npower itself and there is no real distinction between  them.\\nThey represent but two aspects of want of legislative power.\\nThe   legislative   power  of  Parliament  and   the   State\\nLegislatures  as  conferred  by Arts. 245  and  246  of  the\\nConstitution  stands  curtailed by  the  fundamental  rights\\nChapter of the Constitution.\\\"\\nThis decision in clear and unambiguous terms lays down  that\\nthere  cannot  be  any  distinction  on  principle   between\\nConstitutional  incompetency and Constitutional  limitation.\\nIn either case, the Act is void, though in the latter  case,\\nthe pre-constitutional rights and liabilities arising  under\\nthe  statute  are saved.  This Court again  dealt  with  the\\nmeaning  of  the word  void\\u2019 in Bhikaji  Narain  Dhakras  v.\\nState of Madhya Pradesh (2).  There the question was whether\\nan Act \\u2019Which was declared void on the ground of  inconsist-\\nency with the Constitution, can be revived by any subsequent\\namendment  to the Constitution removing  the  inconsistency.\\nThis  Court answered the question in the affirmative.   Das,\\nacting C.; J., observed at page 598 thus:-\\n\\\"  As  explained in Keshavan Madhava Menon\\u2019s case,  the  law\\nbecame void not in toto or for all purposes or for all times\\nor  for  all  persons  but  only  to  the  extent  of   such\\ninconsistency  that  is  to,say, to the  extent,  it  became\\ninconsistent with the provisions of Part\\n(1) [1955] 1 S. C. R. 613.\\n(2) [1955] 2 S. C. R. 589.\\nIII which conferred the fundamental rights on the  citizens.\\nIt did not become void independently of the existence of the\\nrights guaranteed by Part III...... In Short, Article  13(1)\\nhad  the effect of nullifying or rendering the existing  law\\nwhich  had become inconsistent with Art. 19(1)(g) read  with\\nclause (6) as it then stood ineffectual, nugatory and devoid\\nof any legal force or binding effect only with the  exercise\\nof  the  fundamental  right on and after  the  date  of  the\\ncommencement of the Constitution..................... It  is\\nonly as against the citizens that they remained in a dormant\\nor moribund condition.  In our judgment, after the amendment\\nof  clause  (6)  of  Art. 19 on the  18th  June,  1951,  the\\nimpugned  Act  ceased  to  be  unconstitutional  and  became\\nrevivified  and  enforceable  against citizens  as  well  as\\nagainst non-citizens.\\\"\\nThis  judgment  does not say anything  different  from  that\\nexpressed  in Keshavan Madhava Menon\\u2019s case (1) nor does  it\\ndissent from the view expressed by Mahajan, C. J., in Behram\\nKhurshed\\u2019s  case  (2).   The  problem  that  confronted  the\\nlearned  Judges was a different one and they resolved it  by\\napplying  the  doctrine of \\\"eclipse\\u2019.  The  legal  position,\\nvis-a-vis, the law declared to be void either on the  ground\\nof  legislative incompetence or for the reason of  constitu-\\ntional  limitation,  as  stated in  the  earlier  decisions,\\n-remains  unshaken  by  this  decision.   So  long  as   the\\ninconsistency  remains the law continues to be void, at  any\\nrate  vis-a-vis the fundamental rights of a person.  We  are\\nnot concerned in this case with the doctrine of revival; for\\nthe inconsistency of s. 5(1) of the Act with the fundamental\\nright under Art. 14 of the Constitution has not been removed\\nby any amendment of the Constitution.  So long as it is  not\\ndone,  the  said  section  is void  and  cannot  affect  the\\nfundamental  rights of the citizens.  In M. Ct.  Muthiah  v.\\nThe Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras (3), it was  declared\\nthat s. 5(1) of Act XXX of 1947 was unconstitutional on  the\\nground  that  it  infringed the fundamental  rights  of  the\\ncitizens under Art. 14 of the Constitution.\\n(1) [1951] S.C.R. 228.            (2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 613.\\n(3)  [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247.\\nUnder Art. 141 of the Constitution, the law declared by  the\\nSupreme  Court  is binding on all the Courts in  India.   It\\nfollows that the Income-tax Commissioner had no jurisdiction\\nto continue the proceedings against the appellant under  Act\\nXXX  of 1947.  If the Commissioner had no jurisdiction,  the\\nappellant could not by waiving his right confer jurisdiction\\non him.\\nThe  scope of the doctrine of waiver was considered by  this\\nCourt  in  Behram Khurshed\\u2019s case(1).  There  a  person  was\\nprosecuted  for  an  offence under s. 66(b)  of  the  Bombay\\nProhibition Act and he was sentenced to one month\\u2019s rigorous\\nimprisonment.  One of the questions raised there was whether\\ns. 13(b) of the Bombay Prohibition Act, having been declared\\nto be void under Art. 13(1) of the Constitution in so far as\\nit  affected the consumption or use of liquid  medicinal  or\\ntoilet  preparation containing alcohol, the prosecution  was\\nmaintainable  for infringement of that section.   The  Court\\nheld  that  in India once the law has been  struck  down  as\\nunconstitutional  by  the Supreme Court, no  notice  can  be\\ntaken  of it by any Court, because, after it is declared  as\\nunconstitutional, it is no longer law and is null and  void.\\nEven  so, it was contended that the accused had  waived  his\\nfundamental  right  and therefore he could not  sustain  his\\ndefence.   Mahajan,  C. J., delivering the judgment  of  the\\nmajority,  repelled  this  contention  with  the   following\\nobservations at page 653:-\\n\\\"  The  learned Attorney General when questioned  about  the\\ndoctrine  did  not seem to be very  enthusiastic  about  it.\\nWithout  finally expressing an opinion on this  question  we\\nare  not for the moment convinced that this theory  has  any\\nrelevancy in construing the fundamental rights conferred  by\\nPart  III  of our Constitution.  We think  that  the  rights\\ndescribed as fundamental rights are a necessary  consequence\\nof the declaration in the preamble that the people of  India\\nhave solemnly resolved to constitute India into a  sovereign\\ndemocratic  republic  and  to secure  to  all  its  citizens\\njustice,  social,  economic  and  political  ;  liberty  ,of\\nthought, expression, belief, faith and worship;\\n(1)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 613.\\nequality  of status and of opportunity.   These  fundamental\\nrights have not been put in the Constitution merely for  the\\nindividual   benefit  though  ultimately  they   come   into\\noperation in considering individual rights.  They have  been\\nput  there as a matter of public policy and the doctrine  of\\nwaiver  can have no application to provisions of  law  which\\nhave  been  enacted as a matter  of  Constitutional  policy.\\nReference  to  some of the articles,  inter  alia,  Articles\\ncannot  get  discrimination by telling the  State  \\u2019You  can\\ndiscriminate\\u2019,  or get convicted by waiving  the  protection\\ngiven  under Articles 20 and 21.\\\"\\nOn  the  question of waiver, Venkatarama Aiyar, J.,  in  his\\njudgment  before review, considered the  American  decisions\\nand   was  inclined  to  take  the  view  that   under   our\\nConstitution when a law contravenes the provisions  intended\\nfor  the benefit of the individual, it can be  waived.   But\\nthe  learned  Judge made it clear in his judgment  that  the\\nquestion  of  waiver  had no bearing to any  issue  of  fact\\narising for determination in that case but only for  showing\\nthe nature of the right declared under Art. 19(1)(f) and the\\neffect in law of a statute contravening it.  Das, J., as  he\\nthen was, in his dissenting judgment, did not state his view\\non this question but expressly reserved it in the  following\\nwords:-\\n\\\" In coming to the conclusion that I have, I have in a large\\nmeasure  found  myself  in  agreement  with  the  views   of\\nVenkatarama  Aiyar,  J.,  on  that part  of  the  case.   I,\\nhowever, desire to guard myself against being understood  to\\nagree  with the rest of the observations to be found in  his\\njudgment,   particularly   those  relating  to   waiver   of\\n\\u2019unconstitutionality,  the fundamental rights being  a  mere\\ncheck  on  the  legislative  power  or  the  effect  of  the\\ndeclaration  under Art. 13(1) being  relatively  void\\u2019.   On\\nthose topics prefer to express no opinion on this occasion.\\\"\\nI respectfully agree with the observations of Mahajan, C. J.\\nFor the aforesaid reasons,  hold that the doctrine of waiver\\nhas  no application in the case of fundamental rights  under\\nour Constitution.\\n                    623\\n                   ORDER\\nThe  appeal  is  allowed.

In\\nconnection  with  certain  proceedings  pending  before  the\\nIncome  Tax Investigation Commission it was found  necessary\\nto  search two premises 17, Kalakar Street and 36,  Armenian\\nStreet  to  inspect, take copies and  secure  possession  of\\ncertain books, papers and documents believed to be in  them.\\nA  warrant was issued by the Commission for this purpose  in\\nfavour of four persons, namely, H. C. Bhari, A. D. De, A. K.\\nBose and P. Mukherjee, to carry out the search.\\nThe   authorised  officials  went  to  the  Kalakar   Street\\npremises,  third  floor  on the morning  of  December  1950.\\nMatajog  Dobey, (Appellant in Criminal Appeal No.  67),  the\\ndarwan  of Kasbiram Agarwala, says that when he  found  them\\nforcibly  breaking  open the entrance door of  the  flat  he\\nchallenged them and requested them to desist.  They paid  no\\nheed to him, broke open the door, went inside and interfered\\nwith some boxes and drawers of tables.  They tied him with a\\nrope and assaulted him causing injuries.  On these facts, he\\nfiled a complaint on 27-12-1950 against H.C. Bhari and three\\nothers (names unknown) under sections 323, 341, 342 and 109,\\nIndian Penal Code,\\nArmenian  Street  premises  on the  evening  of  26-12-1950.\\nNandram  Agarwala (father of Kashiram Agarwala) came to  the\\nplace  and found that they had forcibly opened the  lock  of\\nthe  door of the room in which there were several books  and\\npapers, which they were collecting and packing into  bundles\\nfor  removal.  He protested, pointed out that their  actions\\nwere  illegal and oppressive, and he wanted a proper  search\\nlist  to be prepared and proper receipts to be given to  him\\nfor the books and documents sought to be seized and removed.\\nThereupon, two policemen held him down and he was  assaulted\\nmercilessly,  kicked,  dragged downstairs, put in  a  police\\nvan,  and taken to the Burra Bazar thana, where he  was  as-\\nsaulted  again  before being sent to the hospital.   He  was\\nbrought  back and kept in the lock up till midnight when  he\\nwas released on bail.  Setting out these facts, he lodged  a\\ncomplaint against the four officials, other subordinates and\\npolice  officers whose names he did not then know but  could\\nsupply  later.  The offences mentioned in the complaint  are\\nsections  323, 342 and 504, Indian Penal Code.   Later,  the\\nnames of two police officers were given-Bibhuti  Chakravarti\\nand Nageswar Tiwari.\\nThe  two complaints were sent over for judicial  inquiry  to\\ntwo  different  magistrates.  On 21-2-1951,  the  magistrate\\nheld  on  Agarwala\\u2019s complaint that a prima facie  case  had\\nbeen  made  out  under section 323  against  all  the  four-\\naccused and under section 342 against the two policemen.  On\\nthis report, summonses were directed to issue under  section\\nwitnesses  were  examined  in  chief  and  the  case   stood\\nadjourned to 22-5-1951.  It was on this latter date that the\\nwant of sanction under section 197, Criminal Procedure Code.\\nThe objection was upheld and all the accused disc barged  on\\nrevision,  but  the order of the Presidency  Magistrate  was\\naffirmed.\\nIn Matajog Dobey\\u2019s complaint, after the termina-\\ntion  of the inquiry, process was issued only against  Bhari\\nunder  sections 323 and 342 , Indian Penal Code  for  22-12-\\npetition  as in the other case raising the  same  objection.\\nThe magistrate on whose file the case was pending  overruled\\nthe  objection  and directed that the case  should  proceed.\\nAccused Bhari took the matter on revision to the High  Court\\nand succeeded.\\nIn  Nandram Agarwala\\u2019s case (Criminal Revision Petition  No.\\nthat  the  test formulated by the Privy  Council  in  Gill\\u2019s\\ncase(1) applied and that on a fair reading of the complaint,\\nbereft  of exaggerations and falsehoods, the officers  could\\nreasonably claim that what they did was done by them in  the\\nexercise  of their official duty.  In Matajog  Dobey\\u2019s  case\\n(Criminal  Revision Petition No. 312 of 1952),  the  learned\\nJudges (Lahiri and Guha, JJ.) came to the same conclusion in\\nthese  words: \\\"From the nature of the allegations  therefore\\nagainst  the petitioner, it is abundantly clear  that  there\\nwas something in the acts alleged against him which attached\\nthem  to the official character of the petitioner, that  is,\\nwhich attached them to his official character in holding the\\nsearch\\\".\\nMr.  Isaacs, learned counsel for the appellants in  the  two\\nappeals,  challenged the soundness of these conclusions  and\\nadvanced  three  categorical contentions  on  their  behalf.\\nFirstly, an act of criminal assault or wrongful  confinement\\ncan  never  be  regarded  as an act  done  while  acting  or\\npurporting  to  act  in  the  discharge  of  official  duty;\\nsecondly,  that in a case where the duty is clearly  defined\\nby  statute and warrant of authority, such acts could  never\\ncome  within the scope of employment; and thirdly,  that  in\\nany  case  it  was  the  duty of  the  court  to  allow  the\\nprosecution to proceed and not stifle it in limine.  He also\\nurged  that  as the entry on the 23rd December  was  into  a\\nwrong  place,  P-17,  Kalakar Street, and  not  17,  Kalakar\\nStreet  which  was the authorised premises, the  search  was\\nillegal from the commencement.  He raised the\\n(1)  [1948] L.R. 75 I.A. 41.\\nconstitutional  point that section 5(1) of the  Taxation  on\\nIncome  (Investigation  Commission)  Act XXX  of  1947)  and\\nsection  197, Criminal Procedure Code were ultra  vires,  as\\nthey  were  discriminatory  in their  nature,  and  offended\\narticle 14 of the Constitution.\\nIn  the  course of his arguments, he referred to  section  6\\nsub-sections   (7)  and  (9)  of  the  Taxation  on   Income\\n(Investigation Commission) Act (XXX of 1947) and rule 10 and\\nthe  search  warrant that was issued under them.   His  main\\nargument was that there was no power conferred by statute or\\nunder  common law on the authorised officials to assault  or\\nuse  force in the execution of their duty and any such  acts\\nmust therefore be deemed to be entirely outside the scope of\\ntheir employment.  He drew our attention to the sections  of\\nthe Criminal Procedure Code relating to searches and  quoted\\ntwo old English cases to reinforce this position.\\nThe search warrant is in these terms:\\n\\\"Warrant  of Authorisation under sections 6(7) and 6(9)  and\\nRule 8.\\nTaxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947.\\nWhereas information has been laid before the Commission  and\\non the consideration thereof the Commission has been led  to\\nbelieve that certain books, documents and papers, which  are\\nor may be relevant to proceedings under the above Act in the\\ncases  compendiously known as the S. Jhabbarmull  group  (R.\\nC. No. 313) and connected cases have been kept and are to be\\nfound  in (i) the third floor, 17, Kalakar Street,  Calcutta\\n(ii)  47  Khengraputty  Street, Calcutta-7,  and  (iii)  the\\nsecond  \\u2019floor  and adjoining rooms,  36,  Armenian  Street,\\nCalcutta,  compound, offices and out-houses or other  places\\nin that locality.\\nThis is to authorise and require you,\\nSri H. C. Bhari,\\nAuthorised Official,\\nIncome-tax Investigation Commission,\\n(a)  to  enter  and search with such  assistance  of  police\\nofficers as may be required, the said premises or any  other\\nplace or places where you may have\\nreason  to believe that such books, documents or papers  may\\nbe found;\\n(b)to  place identification marks on such  books,  documents\\nand papers as may be found and as you may consider  relevant\\nto  the  proceedings aforesaid and to make  a  list  thereof\\ntogether with particulars of the identification marks;\\n(c)  to make copies or extracts from such  books,  documents\\nand papers;\\n(d)  to  seize  such books, documents and  papers  and  take\\npossession thereof; and\\n(e)to  exercise all other powers and duties under  the  said\\nsections and the Rules relating thereto\\\".\\nStraightaway,  it may be conceded that the warrant  set  out\\nabove specifies precisely the scope of the duties  entrusted\\nto   the  authorised  officials.   Whether  they  took   any\\npolicemen with them even at the commencement or whether they\\nwere only sent for when resistance was offered is not clear.\\nThis,  however,  does not matter as the  warrant  authorises\\npolice assistance at the search.\\nThe  version of the complainants as to what happened at  the\\nsearch  is set out in the two complaints.  The story of  the\\naccused is found in the petitions filed by Bhari urging  the\\nobjection  under  section  197,  Criminal  Procedure   Code.\\nDetails about the occurrences were also elicited at the  two\\njudicial  enquiries.   There are  two  medical  certificates\\nspecifying  the  injuries  found  on  Nandram  Agarwala  and\\nMatajog Dobey.\\nThe  minor  contentions may be disposed of  at  the  outset.\\nEven  if  there was anything sound and  substantial  in  the\\nconstitutional point about the vires of section 5(1) of  the\\nAct,  we declined to go into it as it was not raised  before\\nthe High Court or in the grounds of the petition for special\\nleave  to appeal.  Article 14 does not render  section  197,\\nCriminal Procedure Code ultra vires as the discrimination is\\nbased upon a rational classification.  Public servants  have\\nto be protected from harassment in the discharge of official\\nduties while ordinary citizens not so engaged do not require\\nthis safeguard.  It was argued that\\nsection  197, Criminal Procedure Code vested  an  absolutely\\narbitrary  power  in  the government to  grant  or  withhold\\nsanction   at  their  sweet  will  and  pleasure,  and   the\\nlegislature  did not lay down or even indicate  any  guiding\\nprinciples to control the exercise of the discretion.  There\\nis no question of any discrimination between one person  and\\nanother in the matter of taking proceedings against a public\\nservant  for  an act done or purporting to be  done  by  the\\npublic servant in the discharge of his official duties.   No\\none can take such proceedings without such sanction.  If the\\ngovernment  gives  sanction against one public  servant  but\\ndeclines  to  do  so against another,  then  the  government\\nservant   against  whom  sanction  is  given  may   possibly\\ncomplain,  of discrimination.  But the petitioners  who  are\\ncomplainants  cannot  be  heard to say so for  there  is  no\\ndiscrimination  as  against any complainant.  It has  to  be\\nborne in mind that a discretionary power is not  necessarily\\na discriminatory power and that abuse of power is not to  be\\neasily assumed where the discretion is vested in the govern-\\nment  and not in a minor official.  Further, we are not  now\\nconcerned  with  any such question.  We have merely  to  see\\nwhether the court could take cognisance of the case  without\\nprevious sanction and for this purpose the court has to find\\nout  if  the  act complained against was  committed  by  the\\naccused  while acting or purporting to act in the  discharge\\nof  official duty.  Once this is settled, the case  proceeds\\nor is thrown out.  Whether sanction is to be accorded or not\\nis  a matter for the government to consider.   The  absolute\\npower  to  accord  or withhold  sanction  conferred  on  the\\ngovernment is irrelevant and foreign to the duty cast on the\\ncourt, which is the ascertainment of the true nature of  the\\nact.\\nThe  objection based on entry into the wrong premises is  of\\nno  substance;  it  is  quite  probable  that  the   warrant\\nspecified  17  instead of P. 17 by a bona  fide  mistake  or\\nerror;  or it may be that the party made an honest  mistake.\\nAs  a matter of fact, the account books, etc. were found  in\\nP. 17, the premises raided.\\nSlightly differing tests have been laid down in the\\ndecided oases to ascertain the scope and the meaning of  the\\nrelevant  words occurring in section 197 of the  Code;  \\\"any\\noffence  alleged to have been committed by him while  acting\\nor purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty\\\".\\nBut the difference is only in language and not in substance.\\nThe  offence  alleged  to  have  been  committed  must  have\\nsomething to do, or must be related in some manner, with the\\ndischarge  of  official duty.  No question of  sanction  can\\narise under section 197, unless the act complained of is  an\\noffence;  the  only  point to determine is  whether  it  was\\ncommitted in the discharge of official duty.  There must  be\\na  reasonable connection\\u2019 between the act and  the  official\\nduty.   It does not matter even if the act exceeds  what  is\\nstrictly  necessary for the discharge of the duty,  as  this\\nquestion  will  arise only at a later stage when  the  trial\\nproceeds  on the merits.  What we must find out  is  whether\\nthe act and the official duty are so inter-related that  one\\ncan postulate reasonably that it was done by the accused  in\\nthe  performance  of the official duty, though  possibly  in\\nexcess  of the needs and requirements of the situation.   In\\nHori Ram Singh v. The Crown(1), Sulaiman, J. observes:\\n\\\"The  section  cannot be confined to only such acts  as  are\\ndone by a public servant directly in pursuance of his public\\noffice,  though  in excess of the duty or under  a  mistaken\\nbelief  as  to  the  existence of  such  duty.   Nor  is  it\\nnecessary  to  go  to  the length of  saying  that  the  act\\nconstituting the offence should be so inseparably  connected\\nwith  the  official duty as to form part and parcel  of  the\\nsame transaction\\\".\\nThe interpretation that found favour with Varadachariar,  J.\\nin  the  same case is stated by him in these terms  at  page\\ncomplained of that attaches it to the official character  of\\nthe person doing it\\\".  In affirming this view, the  Judicial\\nCommittee of the Privy Council observe in Gill\\u2019s case(1)  \\\"A\\npublic servant can only be said to act or purport to act  in\\nthe discharge of his official duty, if his act is such as to\\n(1) [1939] F.C.R. 159,178.\\n(2) [1948] L.R. 75 I.A. 41.\\nlie within the scope of his official duty .... The test  may\\nwell  be  whether  the public servant,  if  challenged,  can\\nreasonably  claim that, what he does, he does in  virtue  of\\nhis office\\\". Hori Ram\\u2019s case(1) is referred to with approval\\nin the later ease of Lieutenant Hector Thomas Huntley v. The\\nKing-Emperor(1)  but  the  test laid down that  it  must  be\\nestablished  that the act complained of was an official  act\\nappears  to  us  unduly  to narrow down  the  scope  of  the\\nprotection afforded by section 197 of the Criminal Procedure\\nCode  as  defined and understood in the earlier  case.   The\\ndecision  in  Meads  v. The King(1) does not  carry  us  any\\nfurther; it adopts the reasoning in Gill\\u2019s case(1).\\n There are two cases of this Court to which reference may be\\nmade  here.  In Shreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli v. The  State\\nof  Bombay(1),  Bose,  J. observes as follows:  \\\"Now  it  is\\nobvious  that  if  section  197  of  the  Code  of  Criminal\\nProcedure  is  construed  too  narrowly,  it  can  never  be\\napplied, for of course, it is no part of an official\\u2019s  duty\\nto  commit an offence and never can be.  But it is  not  the\\nduty  we  have  to examine so much as the  act,  because  an\\nofficial  act can be performed in the discharge of  official\\nduty  as  well  as in dereliction of it.   The  section  has\\ncontent  and  its  language must  be  given  meaning\\\".   The\\nquestion  of previous sanction also arose in Amrik Singh  v.\\nThe  State of PEPSU(6).  A fairly lengthy discussion of  the\\nauthorities  is followed up with this summary: \\\"If the  acts\\ncomplained  of are so integrally connected with  the  duties\\nattaching to the office as to be inseparable from them, then\\nsanction  under  section 197(1) would be necessary;  but  if\\nthere  was  no  necessary connection between  them  and  the\\nperformance of those duties, the official status  furnishing\\nonly  the  occasion  or opportunity for the  acts,  then  no\\nsanction would be required\\\".\\nThe  result of the foregoing discussion is this: There  must\\nbe a reasonable connection between the act and the discharge\\nof official duty; the act must bear such\\n(1)  [1939] F.C.R. 159,178,\\n(2)  [1944] F.C.R. 262.\\n(3)  [1948] L.R. 75 I.A. 185.\\n(4)  [1948] L.R. 75 I.A. 41.\\n(5)  [1955] 1 S.C.R 1177, 1186.\\n(6)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1302, 1307, 1308.\\nrelation   to  the  duty  that  the  accused  could  lay   a\\nreasonable,  but not a pretended or fanciful claim, that  he\\ndid it in the course of the performance of his duty.\\nIs  the  need for sanction to be considered as soon  as  the\\ncomplaint   is  lodged  and  on  the   allegations   therein\\ncontained?  At first sight, it seems as though there is some\\nsupport for this view in Hori Ram\\u2019s case and also in  Sarjoo\\nPrasad  v. The King-Emperor(1).  Sulaiman, J. says  that  as\\nthe  prohibition  is  against the  institution  itself,  its\\napplicability  must be judged in the first instance  at  the\\nearliest  stage  of  institution.   Varadachariar,  J.  also\\nstates  that the question must be determined with  reference\\nto  the  nature of the allegations made against  the  public\\nservant  in the criminal proceeding.  But a careful  perusal\\nof  the later parts of their judgments shows that  they  did\\nnot  intend to lay down any such proposition.  Sulaiman,  J.\\nrefers (at page 179) to the prosecution case as disclosed by\\nthe  complaint  or  the police report and he  winds  up  the\\ndiscussion  in these words: \\\"Of course, if the case  as  put\\nforward  fails  or  the defence  establishes  that  the  act\\npurported   to  be  done  is  in  execution  of  duty,   the\\nproceedings  will  have  to be  dropped  and  the  complaint\\ndismissed  on  that ground\\\".  The other learned  Judge  also\\nstates  at  page  185, \\\"At this stage we have  only  to  see\\nwhether the case alleged against the appellant or sought  to\\nbe proved against him relates to acts done or purporting  to\\nbe  done by him in the execution of his duty\\\".  It  must  be\\nso.  The question may arise at any stage of the proceedings.\\nThe complaint may not disclose that the act constituting the\\noffence was done or purported to be done in the discharge of\\nofficial  duty; but facts subsequently coming to light on  a\\npolice  or  judicial inquiry or even in the  course  of  the\\nprosecution  evidence  at  the  trial,  may  establish   the\\nnecessity  for sanction.  Whether sanction is  necessary  or\\nnot  may  have to be determined from stage  to  stage.   The\\nnecessity may reveal itself in the course of the progress of\\nthe case.\\nWe are not prepared to concede in favour of the\\n(1)  [1945] F.C.R. 227,\\nappellants   the  correctness  of  the  extreme   proportion\\nadvanced by Mr. Isaacs on their behalf that when obstruction\\nis  laid  or resistance offered against  an  authorised  and\\ntherefore  lawful  search, the officials  conducting  the  -\\nsearch  have no right to remove or cause to be  removed  the\\nobstruction  or resistance by the employment  of  reasonable\\nforce,  and their remedy is only to resort to the police  or\\nthe  magistracy  with  a  complaint.   Such  a  view   would\\nfrustrate the due discharge of the official duty and  defeat\\nthe very object of the search, as the books, etc.. might  be\\nsecreted  or  destroyed  in  the  interval;  and  it   would\\nencourage obstruction or resistance even to lawful acts.  It\\nmay be that more than reasonable force is used to clear  the\\nobstruction  or remove the resistance, but that would  be  a\\nfit  subject-matter for inquiry during the  proceedings;  it\\nwould not make the act of removal improper or unlawful.   It\\nis a matter for doubt if Chapters V and VII of the  Criminal\\nProcedure  Code can be read as an exhaustive enumeration  of\\nall  the powers of a search party.  Anyhow, section 6,  sub-\\nsection  (9) of the Investigation Commission Act  makes  the\\nprovisions  relating to searches applicable only \\\"go far  as\\nthey can be made applicable\\\".\\nThe  two English cases relied on are scarcely of  any  help.\\nIn Jones v. Owen\\\"), a rather startling view was taken that a\\npower to apprehend a person for a statutory offence did  not\\ninclude a power to move that person gently aside.  Hatton v.\\nTreeby(2)  was  a  case where the Act  of  Parliament  which\\ncreated a new offence did not in itself provide for a  power\\nof detention of the offender.\\nWhere  a power is conferred or a duty imposed by statute  or\\notherwise\\u2019  and there is nothing said  expressly  inhibiting\\nthe exercise of the power or the performance of the duty  by\\nany  limitations or restrictions, it is reasonable  to  hold\\nthat it carries with it the power of doing all such acts  or\\nemploying  such means as are reasonably necessary  for  such\\nexecution.   If  in  the  exercise  of  the  power  or   the\\nperformance\\n(1)  [1823] L.J.

This accords with commonsense and does not seem\\ncontrary  to  any principle -of law.  The true  position  is\\nneatly  stated  thus in Broom\\u2019s Legal Maxims, 10th  Ed.,  at\\npage  312: \\\"It is a rule that when the law commands a  thing\\nto be done, it authorises the performance of whatever may be\\nnecessary for executing its command\\\".\\nLet  us  however  assume that Mr. Isaacs  is  right  in  his\\ncontention.   Still, it can be urged that the accused  could\\nclaim  that  what  they did was in the  discharge  of  their\\nofficial duty.  The belief that they had a right to get  rid\\nof  the  obstruction  then and there  by  binding  down  the\\ncomplainants  or  removing  them from  the  place  might  be\\nmistaken,  but, surely, it could not be said that their  act\\nwas  necessarily  mala fide and entirely  divorced  from  or\\nunconnected  with the dig\\u2019 charge of their duty that it  was\\nan  independent act maliciously done or perpetrated.,  They.\\ncould  reasonably claim that what they did was in virtue  of\\ntheir  official duty, whether the claim is found  ultimately\\nto be well-founded or not.\\nReading  the  complaints  alone in  these  two  cases,  even\\nwithout the details of facts as narrated by the witnesses at\\nthe judicial inquiries, it is fairly clear that the  assault\\nand use of criminal force, etc. alleged against the  accused\\nare definitely related to the performance of their  official\\nduties.  But taken along with them, it seems to us to be  an\\nobvious  case  for  sanction.   The  injuries  a  couple  of\\nabrasions  and  a  swelling  on  Nandram  Agarwala  and  two\\necohymosis on Matajog--indicate nothing more than a  scuffle\\nwhich  is  likely  to  have ensued  when  there  were  angry\\nprotests  against  the  search and a pushing  aside  of  the\\nprotestors so that the search may go on unimpeded.\\nMr.  Isaacs  finally  pointed out that  the  fourth  accused\\nNageswar  Tewari  was a constable and the case  should  have\\nbeen allowed to proceed against him at least.  This question\\narises only in Nandram Agarwala\\u2019s case.  The Magistrate  who\\ndismissed the com-\\nplaint  took  the view that theme was no use  in  proceeding\\nagainst  him alone, as the main attack was directed  against\\nthe  Income-Tax  Officials.   No such  grievance  was  urged\\nbefore  the High Court and it is not raised in  the  grounds\\nfor special leave.\\nWe  hold that the orders of the High Court are  correct  and\\ndismiss these two appeals.\",\n          \"CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 14 of 1959.\\nAppeal  by special leave from the Award dated  February  21,\\nat Bombay, in Reference CGIT No. 12 of 1957.\\nSachin  Chaudhury,  S.  N. Andley,  J.  B.  Dadachanji  and,\\nRameshwar Nath, for the appellant.\\nA.   S.  R. Chari and Y. Kumar, for the  respondents.  1960.\\nApril 4. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\\nWANCHOO,  J.-This  is  an  appeal by  special  leave  in  an\\nindustrial  matter.   The appellant is The  Chartered  Bank,\\nBombay  (hereinafter called the Bank).  There was a  dispute\\nbetween  the Bank and its workmen regarding the  termination\\nof  the  service, of one Colsavala (hereinafter  called  the\\nrespondent)  who was working as an assistant cashier in  the\\nBank.   The system of working in the cash department of  the\\nBank  is  that there is a chief cashier and  under  him  are\\nabout  thirty assistant cashiers.  The Chief Cashier has  to\\ngive   security  for  the  work  of  the  cash   department.\\nConsequently  all assistant cashiers are employed  upon  the\\nintroduction  of the Chief Cashier who guarantees each  such\\nemployee.   By  virtue of this guarantee the  Chief  Cashier\\nalone  is  unconditionally responsible to the Bank  for  any\\nshortage  which  might occur in the cash department  and  no\\nsecurity  is  taken  from  the  assistant  cashiers  working\\ntherein.   In  view of this guarantee by the  Chief  Cashier\\nthere  has been a longstanding practice in the Bank that  at\\nthe  end  of the day when the cash is locked  up  under  the\\nsupervision of the Chief Cashier, all the assistant cashiers\\nhave to be present so that the cash may be checked before\\nbeing  locked  up.  Assistant Cashiers  therefore  can  only\\nleave  the  Bank  before the locking up of  the  cash  after\\nobtaining permission of the Chief Cashier.\\nOn  January  4,  1957, the Chief  Cashier  reported  to  the\\nmanagement  that  the respondent had been leaving  the  Bank\\nwithout  his permission for some time past before  the  cash\\nwas  checked  and  locked  up in spite of  the  issue  of  a\\ndepartmental  circular in that behalf on December 24,  1956,\\nby  which all assistant cashiers (including the  respondent)\\nwere reminded of the longstanding practice that no assistant\\ncashier should leave the Bank without the permission of  the\\nChief  Cashier before the cash was checked and  locked  tip.\\nThe  Chief  Cashier therefore stated that he was  unable  to\\ncontinue  to  guarantee the respondent and that  unless  the\\nrespondent\\u2019s  service  was dispensed with his  conduct  will\\naffect  the  security of the cash department.  As  the  Bank\\nwas- not prepared to change the system in force in the  cash\\ndepartment,  the  management decided to  dispense  with  the\\nservice  of  the respondent in accordance with the  mode  of\\ntermination prescribed by paragraph 522(1) of the All  India\\nIndustrial  Tribunal  (Bank Disputes) Award of  March,  1953\\n(hereinafter  referred to as the Bank Award).  The Bank  was\\nalso   unable  to  employ  the  respondent  in   any   other\\ndepartment.   It therefore informed the respondent on  March\\nbeen  withdrawn by the Chief Cashier the Bank was unable  to\\ncontinue to employ him.  The notice required under paragraph\\nincluding retrenchment compensation was paid to him and  his\\nservice  was terminated.  Thereupon a dispute was raised  by\\nthe  workmen  of the Bank and a reference was  made  by  the\\nCentral  Government to the Industrial Tribunal with  respect\\nto the \\\"alleged wrongful termination of the services of Shri\\nN.  D.  Colsavala  by the Chartered Bank,  Bombay,  and  the\\nrelief, if any, to which he is entitled.\\\"\\nThe  case on behalf of the respondent was that he  had  been\\nworking  in the Bank since September 1, 1937,  honestly  and\\nefficiently  as an assistant cashier in the cash  department\\nThe previous Chief Cashier who\\nwas  the father of the present Chief Cashier however  became\\nhostile to him since 1943, because he claimed his legitimate\\ndues  for  overtime  work and leave  which  the  then  Chief\\nCashier was not prepared to allow.  Further the respondent\\u2019s\\nletter  of  appointment  did  not oblige  him  to  give  any\\nsecurity  or  to  procure any guarantee  and  if  the  Chief\\nCashier had given any guarantee to the Bank, the  respondent\\nwas  not concerned with it and had even no knowledge of  it.\\nHe  was given no opportunity to contest the reasons for  the\\nwithdrawal of the guarantee by the Chief Cashier; nor was he\\nasked  to furnish security or give a fidelity bond, even  if\\nthe   Chief  Cashier  had  withdrawn  the   guarantee.    In\\nconsequence the discharge of the respondent from service  on\\nthe ground given by the Bank was entirely illegal,  wrongful\\nand  unjustified and he was entitled to reinstatement or  in\\nthe alternative to full compensation for loss of employment.\\nThe  case of the Bank was that it was entitled to  terminate\\nthe service of the respondent under paragraph 522(1) of  the\\nBank  Award  and  it was not incumbent on it  to  state  the\\nreasons  for such termination and the reasons could  not  be\\ninquired   into  or  examined  by  the  tribunal.   In   the\\nalternative it was submitted that if the tribunal was of the\\nopinion that it was open to it to inquire into the  reasons,\\nthe Bank\\u2019s case was that the respondent was not dismissed or\\ndischarged by way of punishment for any misconduct and  that\\nthe  Bank  merely  terminated his  service  under  paragraph\\nwithdrawn  by  the Chief Cashier and it  was  impossible  to\\ncontinue to employ him in the circumstances, the Bank being.\\nunprepared to change its system of working which has already\\nbeen  mentioned above.  It was also said that the  Bank  was\\nnot  bound to transfer the respondent to another  department\\nand  in  any  case the  respondent\\u2019s  training,  experience,\\nability  or  record did not fit him for work  in  any  other\\ndepartment of the Bank.\\nThe  tribunal held that even though the Bank had  chosen  to\\nfollow  the procedure laid down in paragraph 522(1)  of  the\\nBank Award which provides for termination of employment  \\\"in\\ncases not involving\\ndisciplinary action for misconduct, by three months\\u2019  notice\\nor on payment of three months\\u2019 pay and allow. ances in  lieu\\nof notice\\\", this did not preclude it from inquiring into the\\nreasons for the termination of service and into the legality\\nand/or  propriety of the action taken by the bank  and  that\\nparagraph  522(1)  did not give a free hand to the  Bank  to\\ndispense  with the service of a permanent employee at  will.\\nIt  also  held that it was always open to  the  tribunal  to\\ninquire into the bona fides as well as justifiability of the\\naction taken.  It then went into the circumstances in  which\\nthe  termination  of service took place and was  of  opinion\\nthat  this was in fact and in reality a case of  termination\\nof  service for misconduct, and that it was the duty of  the\\nBank to follow the procedure for taking disciplinary  action\\nfor the alleged insubordination and persistent  disobedience\\nof  the orders of the Chief Cashier by the  respondent  with\\nrespect  to  leaving the Bank without his  prior  permission\\nbefore  the cash was checked and looked up and  inasmuch  as\\nthe  Bank  failed to follow the requisite procedure  as  was\\nlaid   down  in  paragraph  521  of  the  Bank  Award,   the\\ntermination of the service of the respondent was illegal and\\nimproper and he was entitled to reinstatement with full back\\nwages  and other benefits.  It is this order which is  being\\nchallenged before us by the Bank.\\nThe  main  contention on behalf the Bank is  that  the  view\\ntaken by the tribunal that in every case where there may  be\\nsome  misconduct  the  Bank is bound  to  take  disciplinary\\naction under paragraph 521 of the Bank Award makes paragraph\\ncontended  that  in the peculiar position obtaining  in  the\\ncash  department  of  the Bank  whereby  the  Chief  Cashier\\nguarantees all the assistant cashiers working under him, the\\nBank did not want to go into the squabble between the  Chief\\nCashier  and  the respondent and as the  Chief  Cashier  had\\nwithdrawn the guarantee of the respondent, the Bank  decided\\nwithout apportioning any blame between the Chief Cashier and\\nthe  respondent  to act under paragraph 522(1) of  the  Bank\\nAward.  It is urged that paragraph 522(1) of the Bank  Award\\nis\\nparticularly meant to meet situation,,; like this which  may\\narise in a banking concern.\\nThe first question that arises therefore is the scope of the\\npower of the Bank to act under paragraph 522(1) of the  Bank\\nAward, particularly in the peculiar situation prevailing  in\\nthe  cash department of the Bank.  The position in the  cash\\ndepartment of the banks was considered by the Bank Award  in\\nChapter  XXI with respect to giving of security.   In  para-\\ngraphs  417 and 418, the existing practice in various  banks\\nis  summarised and it takes one of three forms,  namely--(i)\\nevery member of the staff is to give security, (ii) the head\\ncashier  gives  a guarantee on behalf of  all  the  cashiers\\nworking  under  him, and (iii) where  the  treasurer  system\\nprevails, the treasurer enters into a contract with the bank\\nand  recommends  the employees for employment  in  the  cash\\ndepartment  and  guarantees  their  fidelity  and  they  are\\nthereupon appointed by the bank.  The tribunal was not right\\nin  saying that the system which was prevailing in the  Bank\\nwas peculiar to it and was not mentioned in the Bank  Award.\\nIt will be seen that the system in the Bank is of the second\\nkind  noticed  in  the Bank Award where  the  Chief  Cashier\\nguarantees  all  those  working  under  him.   It  is   also\\nmentioned in the Bank Award that the Chief Cashier generally\\ntakes  security deposits from persons working under him  but\\nthat  did not appear to be the invariable rule, and  in  the\\nBank  the Chief Cashier does not take any security from  his\\nsubordinates.  In such a system the Bank has to depend  upon\\nthe security given by the Chief Cashier and his guarantee of\\nthe employees working under him.  It is impossible to accept\\nthat  this way of working was not known to  the  respondent.\\nThe  Bank  has  produced the  respondent\\u2019s  application  for\\nemployment and it is significant that it is addressed to the\\nChief Cashier and not to the management of the Bank and this\\nbears  out the contention of the Bank that the  subordinates\\nin the cash department are employed on the recommendation of\\nthe  Chief Cashier who gives guarantee for them.   Nor  does\\nthe  Bank\\u2019s  contention  that no one employed  in  the  cash\\ndepartment  leaves  without  permission  till  the  cash  is\\nchecked and locked up appears\\nimprobable,  for  the  practice  seems  necessary  for   the\\nsecurity  of the cash department.  Therefore when  the  Bank\\nwas  faced with the report of the Chief Cashier  dated  4-1-\\ncase  what  action  should be taken  on  that  report.   Two\\ncourses  were open to it: it could have  taken  disciplinary\\naction  under  paragraph 521 of the Bank Award or  it  could\\nhave acted under paragraph 522(1).  The submission on behalf\\nof the Bank is that it did not want to go into the  squabble\\nbetween  the  Chief Cashier and the respondent  and  as  the\\nChief  Cashier had withdrawn his guarantee with  respect  to\\nthe  respondent  it  acted bona  fide  in  proceeding  under\\nparagraph  522(1) and thus no question arose of  its  taking\\ndisciplinary action against the respondent.\\nThere is no doubt that an employer cannot dispense with  the\\nservices  of a permanent employee by mere notice  and  claim\\nthat the industrial tribunal has no jurisdiction to  inquire\\ninto the circumstances in which such termination of  service\\nsimpliciter   took   place.   Many  standing   orders   have\\nprovisions  similar to paragraph 522(1) of the  Bank  Award,\\nand the scope of the power of the employer to act under such\\nprovisions  has  come  up for  consideration  before  labour\\ntribunals  many a time.  In Buckingham and Carnatic  Company\\nLtd., Etc., v. Workers of the Company, etc. (1), the  Labour\\nAppellate  Tribunal  had occasion to  consider  this  matter\\nrelating  to  discharge  by notice or  in  lieu  thereof  by\\npayment of wages for a certain period without assigning  any\\nreason.  It was of opinion that even in a case of this  kind\\nthe  requirement  of  bona fides is  essential  and  if  the\\ntermination of service is a colourable exercise of the power\\nor  as a result of victimisation or unfair  labour  practice\\nthe  industrial  tribunal  would have  the  jurisdiction  to\\nintervene  and set aside such termination.  Further it  held\\nthat  where  the  termination  of  services  is  capricious,\\narbitrary or unnecessarily harsh on the part of the employer\\njudged  by normal standards of a reasonable man that may  be\\ncogent evidence of victimisation or unfair labour  practice.\\nWe are of opinion that this correctly lays down the scope of\\nthe power of the tribunal to\\n(1)  [1952] L.A.C. 490.\\ninterfere where service is terminated simpliciter under  the\\nprovisions  of a contract or of standing orders or  of  some\\naward  like  the Bank Award.  In order to  judge  this,  the\\ntribunal  will have to go into all the  circumstances  which\\nled  to the termination simpliciter and an  employer  cannot\\nsay  that  it  is not bound to  disclose  the  circumstances\\nbefore  the tribunal.  The form of the order of  termination\\nis not conclusive of the true nature of the order, for it is\\npossible  that  the form may be merely a camouflage  for  an\\norder  of dismissal for misconduct.  It is therefore  always\\nopen  to the tribunal to go behind the form and look at  the\\nsubstance;  and if it comes to the conclusion, for  example,\\nthat  though  in  form  the  order  amounts  to  termination\\nsimpliciter it in reality cloaks a dismissal for  misconduct\\nit  will  be  open to it to set it  aside  as  a  colourable\\nexercise of the power.\\nIt  is on these principles therefore that we have  to  judge\\nthe action taken by the Bank in this case.  In the statement\\nof  claim put in by the workmen there was no  allegation  of\\nvictimisation  or unfair labour practice.  An affidavit  was\\nfiled  by the respondent later before the tribunal in  which\\nit  was said that the Bank had acted mala fide  in  removing\\nhim from service.  But in this affidavit nothing was said as\\nto how the management of the Bank as distinct from the Chief\\nCashier  had  any  reason  to  act  mala  fide  against  the\\nrespondent.  The tribunal also has not recorded any  finding\\nthat  the action of the Bank in terminating the  service  of\\nthe  respondent was mala fide or amounted to  unfair  labour\\npractice  or  was  a  case  of  victimisation.   It  ordered\\nreinstatement  on  the  ground that this was  a  case  where\\ndisciplinary action must and should have been taken and that\\nwas  not  done.  In one part of the award the  tribunal  has\\nremarked  that  if it is found that the Bank has  merely  in\\ncolourable  exercise  of  the power  made  the  order  under\\nparagraph  522(1) of the Bank Award, the order would not  be\\nsustainable.  But there is no finding that the action  taken\\nin  this case was a colourable exercise of the  power  under\\nparagraph  522(1).  It is, however, urged on behalf  of  the\\nrespondent that even though there is no such finding by  the\\ntribunal a perusal of the entire award seems\\nto show that this was what the tribunal thought inasmuch  as\\nit  has  said  that this was a case  in  which  disciplinary\\naction must and should have been taken.  However, as we read\\nthe  award  of the tribunal, the impression that we  get  is\\nthat  its view was that where there is an  allegation  which\\nmay amount to misconduct against an employee of a bank,  the\\nprocedure  under paragraph 521 must always be  followed  and\\nthat  the  procedure  under paragraph 522(1)  can  never  be\\nfollowed;  and  that is why the tribunal did  not  give  any\\nfinding  that  the  action  of the  Bank  was  a  colourable\\nexercise  of  the  power under  paragraph  522(1).   But  as\\nlearned counsel for the respondents has urged before us that\\nthe action in this case is in any case a colourable exercise\\nof the power under paragraph 522(1) we propose to look  into\\nthis aspect of the matter ourselves.\\nIt  is  true that there was some kind of allegation  by  the\\nChief  Cashier which may amount to misconduct in  this  case\\nand if we were satisfied that the termination of service  of\\nthe respondent was due to that misconduct and that the  form\\nof  the order was merely a cloak to avoid holding  a  proper\\nenquiry under paragraph 521, no doubt there would have  been\\nno  case  for interference with the order of  the  tribunal.\\nBut this is a peculiar case depending upon a peculiar system\\nprevalent  in the cash department of the Bank.  That  system\\nis  that  the Chief Cashier gives security  for  the  entire\\nworking  of  the  cash  department  and  is  unconditionally\\nresponsible  for  any loss that might be occasioned  to  the\\nBank   in  that  department.   The  appointments   in   that\\ndepartment  are  made  on the recommendation  of  the  Chief\\nCashier and he gives a guarantee about each employee and  is\\nunconditionally  responsible  to the Bank for  any  shortage\\nwhich  might occur.  It is in these circumstances  that  the\\nBank was faced with the report of the Chief Cashier by which\\nfor the reason given by him he withdrew the guarantee so far\\nas  the respondent was concerned.  The security of the  cash\\ndepartment  was thus involved and if the Bank decided as  it\\nseems  to have done in this case that it would not  go  into\\nthe  squabble between the Chief Cashier and  the  respondent\\nand would use paragraph 522(1) of the\\nBank  Award  to terminate the service of the  respondent  it\\ncannot be said that the Bank was exercising its power  under\\nparagraph  522(1)  in  a colourable  manner.   It  may  have\\nhonestly  come to the conclusion that in this situation,  as\\nit was not possible for it to change its system in the  cash\\ndepartment, there was no option for it but to dispense  with\\nthe service of the respondent under paragraph 522(1) of  the\\nBank  Award without going into the rights and wrongs of  the\\ndispute  between the Chief Cashier and the  respondent.   In\\nthe  peculiar circumstances therefore obtaining in the  cash\\ndepartment of the Bank it cannot in our opinion be said that\\nthe  use of the power under paragraph 522(1) by the Bank  in\\nthe  present case was a colourable exercise of  that  power.\\nNor  do  we think that the failure of the  Bank  to  provide\\nalternative employment for the respondent would lead to  any\\nsuch inference,, for the Bank may very well be right when it\\nsays  that it is a specialised institution  and  considering\\nthat  the respondent has been working in one department  for\\nthe  last  twenty  years he was not fit to  be  absorbed  in\\nanother  department.   In  the circumstances  of  this  case\\ntherefore  we are not prepared to hold that the  termination\\nof  the service of the respondent was a colourable  exercise\\nof the power under paragraph 522(1) of the Bank Award.   The\\nmention  of the fact that the service was  being  terminated\\nbecause the Chief Cashier had withdrawn the guarantee of the\\nrespondent  in the notice of. discharge will not change  the\\nnature  of  the  termination,  for  the  reason  was   given\\nobviously  to  avoid  the charge that  the  termination  was\\nentirely  capricious  or arbitrary, and therefore  not  bona\\nfide.\\nWe therefore allow the appeal and set aside the order of the\\ntribunal   by  which  the  respondent  was  ordered  to   be\\nreinstated with full back wages and other benefits.  In  the\\ncircumstances we pass no order as to costs.\\nAppeal allowed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

The Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras, [1955]  2\\nS.C.R.  1247, the appellant applied to the  Commissioner  of\\nIncome-tax  challenging the validity of the settlement  made\\nunder s. 8A of the Act on the ground that S. 5(1) Of the Act\\non  which  it  was founded had been declared  void  by  this\\nCourt,  and  claimed that his properties might  be  released\\nfrom  attachment  and the amount paid under  the  settlement\\nmight  be  refunded  to  him.,  On  January  29,  1958,  the\\nCommissioner  of  Income Tax sent a reply to  the  appellant\\nmaintaining that the settlement was valid and\\n                    529\\nthat  the  appellant  was bound thereunder  to  pay  up  the\\narrears of instalments and requesting him to continue to pay\\nin  future.   Against this decision of the  Commissioner  of\\nIncome  Tax the. appellant came up to the Supreme  Court  by\\nspecial leave.  It was contended on behalf of the respondent\\nthat   the  Act  laid  down    two   distinct   and separate\\nprocedures,   one  for  investigation  and  the  other   for\\nsettlement and it was the former alone and not the D, latter\\nthat  was affected by the decisions of this Court. and  that\\nthe  appellant by voluntarily entering into  the  settlement\\nhad  waived his fundamental right founded on Art. 14 of  the\\nConstitution.\\nHeld (Per Curiam), that both the contentions must fail.\\nIt  was not correct to say that the Taxation of Income  (In-\\nvestigation  Commission) Act, 1947, laid down two  different\\nprocedures,  one for investigation and assessment  under  s.\\nthe Act and assessment in terms of such settlement and  that\\nwhile  the decision of this Court in M. Ct.  Muthiah v.  The\\nCommissioner of Incometax, Madras, declaring s. 5(1) of  the\\nAct  to be discriminatory and therefore void, affected  only\\nthe former procedure and not the latter.  The Act laid  down\\nbut  one  procedure  and  in  entertaining  a  proposal  for\\nsettlement  as  in the investigation itself  the  Commission\\nexercised the same jurisdiction, and powers and followed the\\none and the same procedure as laid down by ss. 5, 6 and 7 Of\\nthe  Act.  Since the settlement in the instant case  was  no\\nexception  to that rule, it was covered by the decision  and\\nmust be held to be violative of Art. 14 Of the Constitution.\\nM.   Ct. Muthiah v. The Commissioner of Income-tax,  Madras,\\n[1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247, applied.\\nThe observations made in the majority judgment of this Court\\nin Syed Qasim Razvi v. The State of Hyderabad, [1953] S.C.R.\\nthat case and had no application to the facts of the present\\ncase.\\nSyed  Qasim Razvi v. The State of Hyderabad,  [1953]  S.C.R.\\nPer Das, C. J., and Kapur J.-There could be no waiver of the\\nfundamental right founded on Art. 14 Of the Constitution and\\nit  was  not correct to contend that the  appellant  had  by\\nentering into the settlement under s. 8A of the Act,  waived\\nhis  fundamental right under that Article.  Article  14  was\\nfounded  on a sound public policy recognised and valued  all\\nover  the civilised world, its language was the language  of\\ncommand  and it imposed an obligation on the State of  which\\nno  person could, by his act or conduct, relieve it.  As  it\\nwas  not strictly necessary for the disposal of  this  case,\\nthe  question whether any other fundamental right  could  be\\nwaived need not be considered in this connection.\\nLaxamanappa  Hanumantappa jamkhandi v.

The State, A.I.R. 1958 Punj. 294, distinguished and  held\\ninapplicable.\\nPer  Bhagwati  and gubba Rao, jj.-There could be  no  waiver\\n\\u2019.,not  only of the fundamental right enshrined in  Art.  14\\nbut  also of any other fundamental right guaranteed by  Part\\nIII   of  the  Constitution.   The  Constitution   made   no\\ndistinction  between  fundamental  rights  enacted  for  the\\nbenefit  of the individual and those enacted in  the  public\\ninterest  or on grounds of the public policy.  There  could,\\ntherefore,  be  no  justification  for  importing   American\\nnotions  or authority of decided cases to whittle  down  the\\ntranscendental  character  of  those  rights,  conceived  in\\npublic interest and subject only to such limitations as  the\\nConstitution had itself thought fit to impose.\\nArticle  13(2) was in terms a constitutional mandate to  the\\nState  in respect of all the fundamental rights  enacted  in\\nPart III of the Constitution and no citizen could by  waiver\\nof  any  one  of  them  relieve  the  State  of  the  solemn\\nobligation  that lay on it.  The view expressed by  Mahajan,\\nC.  J., in Behram Khurshed Pesikaka v. The State of  Bombay,\\n[1955]  1  S.C.R. 613, correctly laid down the  law  on  the\\npoint.  Since the arguments in the instant case had  covered\\nthe entire field of fundamental rights, there was no  reason\\nwhy the answer should be confined to Art. 14 alone.\\nBehram  Khurshed Pesikaka v. The State of Bombay,  [1955]  1\\nS.C.R.  613; State of Travancore-Cochin v. The  Bombay  Co.,\\nLtd., [1954] S.C.R. 1112 and The State of Bombay v. R. M. D.\\nChamarbaugwala, [1957] S.C.R. 874, referred to.\\nPer  S.  K. Das, J.-It seems clear that Art. 13  itself  re-\\ncognises  the  distinction between  absence  of  legislative\\npower  which  will  make  the law  made  by  an  incompetent\\nlegislature  wholly void, and exercise of legislative  power\\nin  contravention of a restriction or check on  such  power,\\nwhich  will  make  the  law  void  to  the  extent  of   the\\ninconsistency  or contravention; therefore the mere  use  of\\nthe  word \\\" void \\\" in Art. 13 does not necessarily  militate\\nagainst the application of the doctrine of waiver in respect\\nof the provisions contained in Part III of the Constitution.\\nBehram  Khurshed Pesikaka v.

R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala, [1957] S.C.R. 874, referred\\nto.\\nThere was nothing in the two preambles to the Indian and the\\nAmerican  Constitutions  that  could make  the  doctrine  of\\nwaiver applicable to the one and not to the other; since the\\ndoctrine\\napplied  to  the constitutional rights  under  the  American\\nConstitution, there is no reason why it should not apply  to\\nthe fundamental rights under the Indian Constitution.\\nCase-law considered.\\nBut it must be made clear that there is no absolute rule, or\\none  formulated in the abstract, as to the applicability  of\\nthat  doctrine to fundamental rights and such  applicability\\nmust depend on (1) the nature of fundamental right to  which\\nit  is  sought to be applied and (2) the foundation  on  the\\nbasis  of which the plea is raised.  The true test  must  be\\nwhether the fundamental right is one primarily meant for the\\nbenefit  of  individuals or for the benefit of  the  general\\npublic.\\nWhere,  therefore, the Constitution vested the right in  the\\nindividual,  primarily  intending to benefit  him  and  such\\nright  did not impinge on the rights of others, there  could\\nbe  a waiver of such right provided it was not forbidden  by\\nlaw or did not contravene public policy or public morals.\\nAs  in the instant case the respondents who had  raised  the\\nplea,  had failed to prove the necessary facts on  which  it\\ncould be sustained, the plea of waiver must fail.\\nPer  Subba  Rao, J.-Apart from the question  as  to  whether\\nthere  could be a waiver in respect of a fundamental  right,\\ns. 5(1) of the Taxation of Income (Investigation Commission)\\nAct, 1947, having been declared void by this Court in M. Ct.\\nMuthiah v. The Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras, as  being\\nviolative of the fundamental right founded on Art\\u2019 14 Of the\\nConstitution  and such decision being binding on all  courts\\nin India, the Commissioner of Income-tax had no jurisdiction\\nto continue the proceedings against the appellant under that\\nAct  and  the appellant could not by a waiver of  his  right\\nconfer jurisdiction on him.\\nNo  distinction could be made under Art. 13(1) of  the  Con-\\nstitution  between  the  constitutional  incompetency  of  a\\nlegislature  and  constitutional limitation  placed  on  its\\npower of legislation, for a statute declared void on  either\\nground would continue to be so, so long as the inconsistency\\ncontinued.  As the inconsistency of S. 5(1) of the Act  with\\nArt. 14 continued, it must continue to be void.\\nKeshavan Madhava Menon v.

State  of  Madhya\\nPradesh, [1955] 2 S.C.R. 589, referred to.\",\n          \"In pursuance of a search - warrant issued under s. 6 of  the\\nTaxation  on  Income (Investigation  Commission)  Act,  1947\\nauthorising  four  Officials  to  search  two  premises   in\\nCalcutta,  they  went  there and  forcibly  broke  open  the\\nentrance door of a flat in one case and the lock of the door\\nof  a  room in the other case.  On being challenged  by  the\\ndarwan  and the proprietor of the respective  premises  they\\nwere  alleged to have tied the darwan with a  rope,  causing\\nhim   injuries   and  to  have  assaulted   the   proprietor\\nmercilessly with the help of two policemen and kept him in a\\nlock up for some hours.  Two separate complaints-one by  the\\ndarwan  and the other by the proprietor-under ss. 323,  342,\\netc.,  of the Indian Penal Code were instituted  before  two\\ndifferent    Magistrates.    The   common    question    for\\ndetermination  in both the complaints was whether under  the\\ncircumstances  sanction  was necessary under s. 197  of  the\\nCode of Criminal Procedure.\\nHeld that sanction was necessary as the assault and the  use\\nof criminal force related to the performance of the official\\nduties  of the accused within the meaning of s. 197  of  the\\nCode of Criminal Procedure.\\n Art.  14  does not render s. 197 of the  Code  of  Criminal\\nProcedure  ultra vires as the discrimination on the part  of\\nthe Government to grant sanction against one public  servant\\nand   not   against   another  is  based   on   a   rational\\nclassification.\\nA  discretionary power is not necessarily  a  discriminatory\\npower  and abuse of power is not easily to be assumed  where\\nthe  discretion  is vested in the Government and  not  in  a\\nminor official.\\nIn the matter of grant of sanction under s. 197 of the  Code\\nof  Criminal  Procedure, the offence alleged  to  have  been\\ncommitted by the accused must have something to do, or  must\\nbe  related  in some manner with the discharge  of  official\\nduty.  In other words there must be a reasonable  connection\\nbetween the act and the discharge of official duty; the  act\\nmust bear such relation to the duty that the\\naccused could lay a reasonable claim, but not a pretended or\\nfanciful  claim,  that  he  did it in  the  course  of  this\\nperformance of his duty.\\nThe  need for sanction under s. 197 of the Code of  Criminal\\nProcedure is not necessarily to be considered as soon as the\\ncomplaint   is  lodged  and  on  the   allegations   therein\\ncontained.   The  question  may arise at any  stage  of  the\\nproceedings.   The complaint may not disclose that  the  act\\nconstituting the offence was done or purported to be done in\\nthe  discharge  of  official duty;  but  facts  subsequently\\ncoming to light on a police or judicial inquiry, or even  in\\nthe  course  of the prosecution evidence at the  trial,  may\\nestablish ,the necessity for sanction.  Whether sanction  is\\nnecessary  or  not may have to be determined from  stage  to\\nstage.  The necessity may reveal itself in the course of the\\nprogress of the case.\\nWhere  a power is conferred or a duty imposed by statute  or\\notherwise,  and there is nothing said  expressly  inhibiting\\nthe exercise of the power or the performance of the duty  by\\nany  limitations or restrictions, it is reasonable  to  hold\\nthat it carries with it the power of doing all such acts  or\\nemploying  such means as are reasonably necessary  for  such\\nexecution, because it is a rule that when the law commands a\\nthing to be done, it authorises the performance of  whatever\\nmay be necessary for executing its command.\\nGill  and another v.

The  Chief\\nCashier  had  to  give security for the  work  of  the  cash\\ndepartment; the Assistant Cashiers were employed upon  being\\nintroduced  by  the Chief Cashier who guaranteed  each  such\\nemployee.  There was long standing practice in the Bank that\\nat the end of the day when the cash was locked up under  the\\nsupervision of the Chief Cashier, all the assistant cashiers\\nhad  to be present so that the cash could be checked  before\\nbeing  locked  up.  In spite of reminders  C,  an  Assistant\\nCashier, had been leaving the Bank without the permission of\\nthe Chief Cashier for some time before the cash was  checked\\nand locked up.  The Chief Cashier reported the matter to the\\nmanagement,  withdrew  his  guarantee in respect  of  C  and\\nstated that unless the services of C were dispensed with his\\nconduct  would affect the security of the  cash  department.\\nThe Bank terminated the services of C in accordance with the\\nprovisions  of  para.  522(1) of the  All  India  Industrial\\nTribunal  (Bank Disputes) Award, 1953, without  holding  any\\nenquiry  against  C. The Industrial Tribunal  to  which  the\\ndispute  was  referred  held that this was in  fact  and  in\\nreality a case of termination of services for misconduct and\\nthe  Bank ought to have followed the procedure laid down  in\\npara. 521 of the Bank Award for taking disciplinary  action,\\nthat the termination of service was illegal and improper and\\nthat  C was entitled to reinstatement with full  back  wages\\nand other benefits :\\nHeld,  that  the  services of  the  Assistant  Cashier  were\\nproperly terminated by the Bank.  There was no doubt that an\\nemployer could not dispense with the services of a permanent\\nemployee  by  mere  notice and  claim  that  the  industrial\\ntribunal   had   no  jurisdiction  to   inquire   into   the\\ncircumstances  of such termination.  Even in a case of  this\\nkind the requirement of bona fides was essential and if  the\\ntermination  of  service was a colourable  exercise  of  the\\npower  or  as  a result of victimisation  or  unfair  labour\\npractice the tribunal had jurisdiction to interfere.   Where\\nthe  termination  of service was  capricious,  arbitrary  or\\nunnecessarily   harsh  that  may  be  cogent   evidence   of\\nvictimisation  or  unfair labour practice.  In  the  present\\ncase the security of the\\nBank was involved and if the Bank decided that it would  not\\ngo  into  the squabble between the Chief Cashier and  C  and\\nwould  use para. 522(1) of the Bank Award to  terminate  the\\nservices  of C it could not be said the Bank was  exercising\\nits  power under para. 522(1) in a. colourable  manner.

Settlement of cases under investigation:(1) Where any\\nPerson  concerned in any case referred to or pending  before\\nthe  Commission for investigation applies to the  Commission\\nat  any time during such investigation to have the  case  or\\nany part thereof settled in so far as it relates to him, the\\nCommission shall, if it is of opinion that the terms of  the\\nsettlement  contained  in the application may  be  approved,\\nrefer  the  matter  to the Central Government,  and  if  the\\nCentral Government accepts the terms of such settlement, the\\nCommission  shall  have  the  terms  thereof  recorded   and\\nthereupon  the  investigation, in so far as  it  relates  to\\nmatters  covered by such settlement, shall be deemed  to  be\\nclosed.\\n(2)  For  the  purpose  of  enforcing  the  terms  of   any,\\nsettlement arrived at in pursuance of sub-section (1),\\n                    537\\nthe  Central Government may direct that such proceedings  as\\nmay be appropriate under the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 (XI\\nof 1922), the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 (XV of 1940),  or\\nany  other law may be taken against the person to  whom  the\\nsettlement relates, and in particular the provisions of  the\\nsecond  proviso to clause (a) of-sub-section (5) of  section\\napplicable  to  the recovery of any sum  specified  in  such\\nsettlement by the, Income Tax Officer having jurisdiction to\\nassess the person by whom such sum is payable as if it  were\\nincome-tax or an arrear of income-tax within the meaning  of\\nthose provisions.\\n(3)  Subject to the provisions of sub-section (6) of section\\nconclusive  as to the matters stated therein, and no  person\\nwhose case has been so settled be entitled to re-open in any\\nproceeding for the recovery of any sum under this section or\\nin  any  subsequent assessment  or  reassessment  proceeding\\nrelating  to taxation on income or in any  other  proceeding\\nbefore  any Court or other authority any matter which  forms\\npart of such settlement.\\n(4)  Where  a  settlement has been  accepted  by  Government\\nunder  sub-section (1), no proceedings under section  34  of\\nthe  Indian  Income  Tax Act, 1922 (XI of  1922),  or  under\\nsection 15 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 (XV of 1940),\\nshall be initiated in respect of the items of income covered\\nby the settlement, unless the initiation of such proceedings\\nis expressly allowed by the terms of the settlement.\\\"\\nOn  July  5, 1949, the total wealth statement  was  received\\nback  from the authorised official.  Our  Constitution  came\\ninto force on January 26, 1950.  The order-sheet shows  that\\nthe authorised official on May 26, 1950, issued a notice  to\\nthe  assessee  fixing the hearing for June 10,  1950,  which\\nindicates  that the authorised official was proceeding  with\\nthe  investigation  set in motion by the  reference  of  the\\nassessee\\u2019s\\ncase  to  the  Commission.  The  assessee  appears  to  have\\nattended on June 6, 1950, with an application for  extension\\nof time which apparently was given.  On September 30,  1950,\\nthe  assessee supplied certain statements of his firm.   The\\nentry  in  the order-sheet ,,,against the date  October  31,\\ntime.   There  appears to be a hiatus of about 3  years  and\\nevidently  nothing  was done until June 9,  1953,  when  the\\nauthorised  official fixed the hearing of the case  on  June\\nreport to the Commission on June 9. 1953.  The assessee  was\\nexamined  on October 9, 10 and 13, 1953, and the  authorised\\nofficial submitted his final report on October 19, 1953.  On\\nJanuary  30,  1954,  notice was issued to  the  assessee  to\\nappear   before  the  Commission  on  February   15,   1954.\\nPresumably  to  get ready for the hearing the  assessee,  on\\nFebruary 5, 1954, asked for inspection of certain assessment\\norders  concerning  his case-, for the return of  his  lease\\ndeed  filed  by him and a copy of the statement  of  one  L.\\nKalidas  and for production of certain documents before  the\\nCommission.  The hearing, which had been fixed for  February\\nwas  examined  on March 4,. 1954.  On March  29,  1954,  the\\nassessee  asked for a, copy of the deposition given  by  the\\nwitness Durgadas before the Commission.  After the  evidence\\nwas closed notice was issued to the assessee on May 1, 1954,\\nasking him to appear before the Commission on May 19,  1954.\\nOn that date the assessee attended, arguments were heard and\\norders  were  reserved.  Learned counsel  for  the  assessee\\nstates  that at the close of the arguments on May 19,  1954,\\nthe  Commission announced its view that the income,  profits\\nand  gains that had escaped assessment in the hands  of  the\\nassessee  for the period beginning with April 1,  1939,  and\\nending  March 31, 1947, were the sum of Rs.  4,47,915,  that\\nthe  Commission also threw a hint that should  the  assessee\\naccept the said finding he would be granted the benefit of a\\nsettlement  on the lower concessional basis of.  payment  of\\nother  alternative than to make the best of the bad  job  by\\nproposing  a  settlement  under s. 8A offering  to  pay  Rs.\\nis  amply borne out by paragraphs 3 and 4 of the  settlement\\napplication filed by the assessee on May 20, 1954, a copy of\\nwhich  has been produced before us by the respondents.   The\\nCommission on May 24, 1954, made a report under s. 8A (1) to\\nthe Central Government that it was of opinion that the terms\\nof   settlement  contained  in  the  application  might   be\\napproved.   The  Central  Government  having  accepted   the\\nproposed  settlement, the Commission had the  terms  thereof\\nrecorded.  The Central Government by its Order C No. 74  (9-\\nIT)  54  made  on  July 5, 1954, under  s.  8A  (2)  of  the\\nInvestigation Act directed that demand notice in  accordance\\nwith the said terms be served immediately by the Income  Tax\\nOfficer and that all such other proceedings under the Indian\\nIncome  Tax  Act or other law as may be necessary  be  taken\\nwith  a view to enforce the payment of the demand  and  that\\nthe  entire sum of Rs. 3,50,000 be demanded in one sum.   It\\nappears,  however,  that the assessee was  allowed  to  make\\npayments by instalments of Rs. 5,000, per month.\\nIn  the  meantime  on May 28,  1954,  this  Court  delivered\\njudgment  in  Suraj Mall Mohta and Co. v. A.  V.  Visvanatha\\nSastri (1).  In that case in the course of investigation  of\\nthe  case of Messrs.  Jute and Gunny Brokers Ltd. which  had\\nbeen  referred  to  the Commission under s.  5  (1)  of  the\\nInvestigation Act, it was alleged to have been discovered by\\nthe Commission that Suraj Mall Mohta and Co. had made  large\\nprofits  which  they had not disclosed and had  thus  evaded\\ntaxation.   A  report  to that effect having  been  made  on\\nAugust 28, 1953, by the Commission to the Central Government\\nunder  s.  5  (4)  of  the  Investigation  Act  the  Central\\nGovernment  on September 9, 1953, referred the case  against\\nSuraj  Mall  Mohta  and  Co. to  the  Commission  under  the\\nprovisions  of  s.  5  (4).   On  September  15,  1953,  the\\nCommission notified Suraj Mall\\n[1955]  1 S.C.R.448\\nMohta  and  Co.  that  their cases  had  been  referred  for\\ninvestigation  and  called  upon  them  to  furnish  certain\\nmaterials, details of which were set out in annexure to  the\\npetition.  On April 12, 1954, Suraj Mall Mohta and Co. filed\\na  petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution asking for  an\\nappropriate writ restraining the, Commission from taking any\\naction   on   the  ground  that  the   provisions   of   the\\nInvestigation  Act had become void being  discriminatory  in\\ncharacter.  By that judgment this Court held that both s. 34\\nof  the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922, as it then  stood,  and\\nsub-s.  (4)  of  s. 5 of the Investigation  Act  dealt  with\\npersons who had similar characteristics of being persons who\\nhad not truly disclosed their income and had evaded  payment\\nof tax on their income but that as the procedure  prescribed\\nby the Investigation Act was substantially more  prejudicial\\nthan  the procedure under the Indian Income Tax  Act,  1922,\\nsub-s.  (4)  of  s. 5 and the procedure  prescribed  by  the\\nInvestigation   Act,-in  so  far  as  it  affected   persons\\nproceeded  against  under that sub-section was  a  piece  of\\ndiscriminatory legislation which offended the provisions  of\\nArt.  14  of the Constitution and was, therefore,  void  and\\nunenforceable.\\nSub-section (4) of s. 5 of the Investigation Act having been\\ndeclared  void,  Parliament  passed the  Indian  Income  Tax\\nAmendment  Act  (33 of 1954) amending s. 34  of  the  Indian\\nIncome  Tax  Act,  1922.  Paradoxical as it  may  seem,  the\\nresult  of this amendment was that persons  who  originally,\\nfell only within the ambit of s. 5 (1) of the  Investigation\\nAct  and formed a distinct class of substantial tax  evaders\\nalso came within the amended s. 34 of the Indian Income  Tax\\nAct, 1922.  The position after the amendment, therefore, was\\nthat  the Income Tax Officers could pick out some  of  these\\npersons and refer their cases under s. 5 (1) of the Investi-\\ngation Act and thereby subject them to the drastic and harsh\\nprocedure  of  that Act, while they could  deal  with  other\\npersons  similarly situate under s. 34 as amended and  apply\\nto  them  the comparatively more beneficial  procedure  laid\\ndown  in the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922.  Promptly  several\\napplications were\\nmade  under  Art. 32 of the  Constitution  complaining  that\\nafter  the amendment of s. 34 of the Indian Income Tax  Act,\\ns.  5 (1) of the Investigation Act became discriminatory  in\\nthat the persons falling within it could be dealt with under\\nthe  drastic, prejudicial and harsh procedure prescribed  by\\nthe  Investigation  Act,  while    other   persons similarly\\nsituate and belonging to the same category could at the whim\\nor  pleasure  of  the Income Tax  authorities  be  proceeded\\nagainst under the more beneficial procedure prescribed under\\nthe  Indian  Income Tax Act.  All  those  applications  were\\ndisposed of by a common judgment reported as Shree Meenakshi\\nMills  Ltd.  v. Sri A. V. Visvanatha Sastri (1)  This  Court\\nheld  that  s. 34 of the Income Tax Act, as amended  by  the\\nIndian Income Tax Amendment Act, 1954 (33 of 1954), operated\\non the same field as s. 5 (1) of the Investigation Act, and,\\ntherefore, s. 5 (1) had become void and unenforceable as the\\nprocedure  applied to persons dealt with  thereunder  became\\ndiscriminatory  in  character.  It should be noted  that  in\\nnone of those petitions disposed of by that judgment had any\\nassessment  been made under the Investigation Act  and  this\\nCourt   only  prohibited  further  proceedings  before   the\\nCommission  under  the  Investigation  Act.   The   assessee\\nappellant  now before us who had entered into  a  settlement\\nunder s. 8 of the Investigation Act and had been assessed in\\naccordance with the terms of the settlement continued to pay\\nthe tax by monthly instalments of Rs. 5,000 as before.\\nFinally  on  December 20, 1955, came the  decision  of  this\\nCourt in M. CT.  Muthiah v. The Commissioner of Income  Tax,\\nMadras (2). In that case the Central Government had under s.\\nCommission.    The  Commission  after  holding  an   enquiry\\nrecorded its findings and held that an aggregate sum of  Rs.\\nperiod under investigation.  The Commission having submitted\\nits  report  to the Central Government,  the  latter  acting\\nunder  s.  8  (2) of the  Investigation  Act  directed  that\\nappropriate action under the\\n(1) [1955] 1 S. C. R. 787.\\n(2) [1955] 2 S. C. R. 1247.\\nIndian Income Tax Act, 1922, be taken against that  assessee\\nwith  a  view to assess or re-assess the  income  which  had\\nescaped  assessment for the period 1940-41 to 1948-49.   The\\nIncome  Tax Officer accordingly issued notices and made  the\\nre-assessment for the years 1940-41, 1941-42 and 1943-44  to\\ntreated  as final and conclusive.  These  assessment  orders\\nwere  served on that assessee.  There was, however,  no  re.\\nassessment  order  for the year 1942-43.  In regard  to  the\\nassessment  orders  which  had  been  served  the   assessee\\nconcerned applied to the Commissioner of Income Tax under S.\\nCourt on questions of law arising out of those re-assessment\\norders.   During  the  pendency  of  those  proceedings  the\\nassessee, in that case on December 6, 1954, filed a petition\\ncontending that the provisions of the Investigation Act were\\nillegal, ultra vires and unconstitutional.  The majority  of\\nthis Court held that different persons, though falling under\\nthe same class or category of substantial evaders of income.\\ntax,  were  being subjected to different procedures,  one  a\\nsummary  and  drastic  procedure and the  other  the  normal\\nprocedure  which gave to the assessees various rights  which\\nwere  denied to those who were specially treated  under  the\\n-procedure   prescribed  by  the  Investigation   Act   and,\\ntherefore, the assessments made under s. 8 (2) were void and\\nunenforceable.  That was a case of assessment under s. 8 (2)\\nin  invitum after an investigation under  the  Investigation\\nAct.   The assessee appellant before us, who had at the  end\\nof  the  investigation entered into a  settlement  and  been\\nassessed  in accordance with the terms of  such  settlement,\\nhowever, went on making payments in discharge of the balance\\ndue  under the terms of settlement right up to September  8,\\nthe aggregate payment up to Rs. 1,28,000.\\nIn   the  meantime  the  Income  Tax  Officer  had  sent   a\\ncertificate  requesting  the  Collector  of  Delhi  for  the\\nrecovery  of  the  balance due by  the  assessee  under  the\\nsettlement.  In execution of that certificate some of\\n                    543\\nthe   properties  belonging  to  the  assessee  situate   in\\nDharamsalla and Hissar were attached.  On December 27, 1957,\\nthe   assessee  made  an  application  to  the  Income   Tax\\nCommissioner.  After pointing out that between July 5, 1954,\\nand  December 27, 1957, the petitioner had paid in  all  Rs.\\nsettlement  and referring to the decisions of this Court  in\\nsuraj  Mall  Mohta\\u2019s  case (1) and Muthiah\\u2019s  case  (2)  the\\nassessee  submitted that the settlement under a. 8A  of  the\\nInvestigation Act had no force and did not bind the petitio-\\nner and that the settlement had been made under the pressure\\nof  the situation and in view of the coercive  machinery  of\\nthe Investigation Act and that from either point of view the\\nsettlement was not binding.  His contention was that when s.\\nthe  settlement under s. 8A could not be enforced,  for  the\\nfoundation of the proceedings under s. 8A was the  reference\\nunder  s. 5(1) and the foundation having crumbled  down  the\\nsuperstructure  must fall with it.  Under the  circumstances\\nthe  assessee  submitted  that the  attached  properties  be\\nreleased   and  the  amount  already  recovered  under   the\\nsettlement be refunded.  On January 29, 1958, the Income Tax\\nCommissioner   sent  the  following  communication  to   the\\nassessee:-\\nNo. L-228(1)/54-55/17590\\n Office  of  the Commissioner Income Tax  Delhi  and\\nRajasthan, New Delhi.\\n Dated,  New  Delhi the 29th  January,  1958.   Shri\\nBesheshar Nath,\\nNew Delhi.\\nDear Sir,\\nSub:-Taxation  on  Income  (Investigation  Commission)  Act,\\nWith  reference to your petition dated 27th December,  1957,\\nregarding the settlement arrived at\\n(1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 448.\\n(2) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247.\\nunder section 8A(2) of the Taxation on Income (Investigation\\nCommission)  Act,  1947,  I  am  to  inform  you  that   the\\nsettlement is valid and binding on you.\\ninstalments  which  you  have  not  paid  recently  by   5th\\nFebruary, 1958, and also to continue making the payments  in\\naccordance  with the instalments scheme agreed  to,  failing\\nwhich  the recovery proceedings will be  vigorously  pursued\\nthrough the usual recovery channels.\\n             Your\\u2019s faithfully,\\n             Sd./- S. K. Gupta,\\n         Commissioner of Income-tax,\\n        Delhi & Rajasthan, New Delhi.\\nBeing aggrieved by the above decision the assessee thereupon\\nmoved  this  Court  and obtained  special  leave  to  appeal\\nagainst  that order.  The appeal has now come up  for  final\\ndisposal before us.\\nIt may be mentioned here that as the respondents are anxious\\nto  have  the matters of controversy raised in  this  appeal\\ndecided  and  set at rest by a decision of this  Court,  the\\nrespondents,  for  the  purposes of this  appeal,  have  not\\ninsisted  on  their objection that an appeal  does  not  lie\\nunder  Art. 136 of the Constitution against an order of  the\\nCommissioner  of  Income  Tax.   Learned  counsel  for   the\\nassessee  also has not pressed his claim for refund  of  the\\namounts  already paid and has pressed the  appeal  regarding\\nthe  balance  that remains to be paid under  the  settlement\\nwhich   is   characterised  as  invalid.    Model   Knitting\\nIndustries  Ltd. which has a case pending in the High  Court\\nof Calcutta where the same questions as are in issue in  the\\nappeal  before us, are also in issue has been. permitted  to\\nintervene  and  we  have heard counsel  appearing  for  that\\nintervener.\\nIn  view  of the three decisions referred to  above  learned\\nAttorney General does not seriously contend that the  powers\\nconferred  on the Commission by s. 6 and the procedure  laid\\ndown   by   s.   7  of  the  Investigation   Act   are   not\\ndiscriminatory,  but what he urges is that none of the  said\\ndecisions has held that s. 5(1) is\\n                    545\\nwholly  void  and inoperative.  He says that  s.  5(1)  only\\nauthorises the Central Government to refer certain cases  to\\nthe  Commission.   Upon  such  a  reference  two  lines   of\\nprocedure  are clearly indicated by the  Investigation  Act,\\nnamely,  (1)  that an investigation may be held  in  invitum\\nfollowing the procedure prescribed and exercising the powers\\nconferred by the lnvestigation Act and (2) that a settlement\\nmay be made under s. 8A.  If the first procedure is followed\\nand an assessment is made under s. 8(2) such assessment will\\nundoubtedly  be invalid as has been held in  Muthiah\\u2019s  case\\n(1),  but  if  on  a  case  being  referred  the  settlement\\nprocedure  is  followed  then  the  consequential  order  of\\nassessment under s. 8A cannot be questioned.  We are  unable\\nto  accept this line of argument as permissible in  view  of\\nthe  provisions  of  the  Investigation  Act.   It  will  be\\nrecalled that when the case of the assessee was referred  to\\nthe Commission under s. 5(1) on July 22, 1948, there was  no\\nprovision for settlement in the Act at all.  Therefore, that\\nreference,  when it was made, consigned the assessee to  the\\nonly procedure of investigation that was then prescribed  by\\nthe  Act.   In the next place it should be  remembered  that\\nafter  s. 8A was added in the Investigation Act by s. 33  of\\nAct 67 of 1949 an authorised official was appointed under s.\\nexamine  the books and to interrogate any person  or  obtain\\nany  statement  from  any person and under  sub-s.  (4)  the\\nauthorised  official  was  empowered to  exercise  the  same\\npowers  as had been vested in the Commission  under  sub-ss.\\n(1) and (2) of s. 6. Further, by its own terms s. 8A made it\\nclear that the person concerned in any case referred to  the\\nCommission  for investigation might apply to the  Commission\\nat  any  time  during such investigation to  have  the  case\\nsettled.   Therefore  this provision for settlement  was  an\\nintegral part of the entire investigation procedure.  It was\\nnot  a  separate  or independent procedure  apart  from  the\\ninvestigation procedure.  It is true that there was  nothing\\nto prevent the assessee from straightaway\\n(1)  [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247.\\nmaking  a  proposal for settlement before  any  actual  step\\ntowards   investigation  -was  taken  by  the   Income   Tax\\nauthorities,  but  before  the Commission  could  refer  the\\nproposal for settlement to the Central Government it had  to\\nbe  satisfied that the terms of settlement contained in  the\\napplication were such as might be approved.  For the purpose\\nof satisfying itself the Commission had obviously to go into\\nthe facts either by itself or through an authorised official\\nand  to consider the materials collected by  the  authorised\\nofficial  and  in  the process of doing so had  to  hold  an\\ninvestigation of some sort and that investigation had neces-\\nsarily   to  be  made  in  accordance  with  the   procedure\\nprescribed   by  the  Investigation  Act  itself.   It   is,\\ntherefore,  not  correct to say that there could be  a  pro-\\nceeding for settlement without any investigation at all.  In\\nour  opinion s. 8A did not provide for a separate  procedure\\nat  all.   When  a case was referred under s.  5(1)  it  was\\nreally  for  investigation and a  settlement  was  something\\nwhich  could  crop up in the process of  that  investigation\\njust  as in the course of a suit parties may arrive at  some\\ncompromise.   In  recording  the compromise  and  passing  a\\njudgment  in  accordance with the  compromise  thereof,  the\\ncourt  exercises  the same jurisdiction as it  exercises  in\\nentertaining and disposing of the suit itself.  Likewise  in\\nentertaining  a  proposal  for  settlement  the   Commission\\nexercised  its  jurisdiction of investigation  under  s.  5,\\nfollowed the procedure prescribed by s. 7 and exercised  all\\nits  powers  under s. 6. As already stated the  language  of\\ns.8A  itself  shows that a settlement can be  proposed  only\\nduring such investigation.  In our judgment, therefore,  the\\ncontention   of  the  learned  Attorney  General  that   the\\nInvestigation  Act  prescribed two procedures is  not  well-\\nfounded.\\nLearned   Attorney   General  then  points  out   that   the\\nInvestigation Act was a pre-Constitution Act and that before\\nthe commencement of the Constitution when there was no  such\\nthing  as a fundamental right, its provisions could  not  be\\nquestioned  however  discriminatory the procedure  may  have\\nbeen.    He  urges  that  after  the  commencement  of   the\\nConstitution the\\nassessee  has not been subjected to the  coercive  procedure\\nlaid   down  by  the  Investigation  Act,  but   voluntarily\\n-proposed  a  settlement which was accepted by  the  Central\\nGovernment on the recommendation of the Commission.  In that\\nsituation  he  was in the same position as Qasim  Razvi  had\\nbeen in and the observations to be found in the judgment  of\\nMukherjea,  J., who delivered the majority judgment in  Syed\\nQasim  Razvi  v. The State of Hyderabad (1) applied  to  the\\npresent  appeal.  We do not think it is necessary,  for  the\\npurpose  of  this appeal, to go minutely into the  facts  of\\nQasim   Razvi\\u2019s  case  (1)  with  reference  to  which   the\\nobservations  relied  on had been made, or  to  analyse  the\\ncorrectness of the reasoning adopted in that case, for  that\\ncan  only be done by a larger Bench.  We are  definitely  of\\nopinion, however, that the observations made in the majority\\njudgement  should not be extended but must be kept  strictly\\nconfined to the special facts of that case. In our judgement\\nthose observations have no \\u02dcapplication to the facts of  the\\npresent   appeal  before  us,  for  here  even   after   the\\ncommencement   of   the   Constitution,   the   process   of\\ninvestigation continued in that the authorised official went\\non   collecting   materials  by  following   the   procedure\\nprescribed  by s. 7 and exercising the powers  conferred  on\\nhim by s. 6 of the Investigation Act.\\nThe  last argument advanced by the learned Attorney  General\\nis  that  if  there  had been a  breach  of  the  assessee\\u2019s\\nfundamental  right  by subjecting him  to  a  discriminatory\\n-procedure laid down in the Investigation Act, the  asessee,\\nby voluntarily entering into a settlement, must be taken  to\\nhave  waived such breach and cannot now be permitted to  set\\nup  his fundamental right.  Immediately two questions  arise\\nfor  consideration, namely, (1) whether the  assessee  could\\nwaive  the breach of the fundamental right in  question  and\\n(2)  whether in the facts and circumstances of this case  he\\nhad actually done so.\\nRe. (1): In Behram Khurshed Pesikaka v. State of\\nBombay (2) there was a general discussion whether a\\n(1)  [1953] S.C.R. 589.\\n(2)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 613.\\nfundamental right could be waived.  At page 638  Venkatarama\\nAiyar, J., observed:-\\n\\\"  The  question is, what is the legal effect of  a  statute\\nbeing  declared unconstitutional.  The answer to it  depends\\non  two  considerations  firstly  does  the   constitutional\\nprohibition  which has been infringed affect the  competence\\nof  the  Legislature  to enact the law  or  does  it  merely\\noperate  as  a check on the exercise of a  power  which  is-\\nwithin  its  competence;  and secondly, if it  is  merely  a\\ncheck, whether it is enacted for the benefit of  individuals\\nor  whether  it is imposed for the benefit  of  the  general\\npublic  on  grounds  of public policy.  If  the  statute  is\\nbeyond  the competence of the Legislature, as  for  example,\\nwhen  a  State enacts a law which is  within  the  exclusive\\ncompetence of the Union, it would be a nullity.  That  would\\nalso  be  the position when a limitation is imposed  on  the\\nlegislative  power in the interests of the public,  as,  for\\ninstance, the provisions in Chapter XIII of the Constitution\\nrelating  to inter-State trade and commerce.  But  when  the\\nlaw  is  within the competence of the  Legislature  and  the\\nunconstitutionality  arises by reason of its  repugnancy  to\\nprovisions enacted for the benefit of individuals, it is not\\na   nullity   but   is  merely   unenforceable.    Such   an\\nunconstitutionality  can be waived and in that case the  law\\nbecomes  enforceable.   In America this  principle  is  well\\nsettled. (Vide Cooley on Constitutional Limitations,  Volume\\nat pages 28 and 29-30).\\\"\\nAfter  referring to three decisions of the American  Supreme\\nCourt  which are also now relied on by the learned  Attorney\\nGeneral, the learned Judge concluded as follows:-\\n\\\" The position must be the same under our Constitution  when\\na law contravenes a prescription intended for the benefit of\\nindividuals.   The rights guaranteed under Art. 19  (1)  (f)\\nare enacted for the benefit of owners of properties and when\\na law is found to infringe that provision, it is open to any\\nperson whose rights have been infringed to waive it and when\\nthere\\n                    549\\nis waiver there is no legal impediment to the enforcement of\\nthe  law.   It  would  be otherwise if  the  statute  was  a\\nnullity;  in  which  case  it  can  neither  be  waived  nor\\nenforced.   If then the law is merely unenforceable and  can\\ntake  effect when waived it cannot be treated as non and  as\\neffaced  out of the statute book.  It is scarcely  necessary\\nto  add  that  the question of waiver  is  relevant  to  the\\npresent  controversy  not as bearing on any  issue  of  fact\\narising  for determination in this case but as  showing  the\\nnature  of the right declared under Art. 19 (1) (f) and  the\\neffect in law of a statute contravening it.\\\"\\nWhen the case came up before the court on review Mahajan, C.\\nJ.,  with  the concurrence of Mukherjea,  Vivian  Bose,  and\\nGhulam Hassan, JJ., said at page 653:-\\n\\\" In our opinion, the doctrine of waiver enunciated by  some\\nAmerican  Judges  in construing  the  American  Constitution\\ncannot  be introduced in our Constitution without  a  fuller\\ndiscussion of the matter.  No inference in deciding the case\\nshould have been raised on the basis of such a theory.   The\\nlearned Attorney General when questioned about the  doctrine\\ndid  not  seem to be very enthusiastic  about  it.   Without\\nfinally  expressing an opinion on this question we  are  not\\nfor the moment convinced that this theory has any  relevancy\\nin  construing the fundamental rights conferred by Part  III\\nof our Constitution.  We think that the rights described  as\\nfundamental  rights  are  a  necessary  consequence  of  the\\ndeclaration  in the preamble that the people of  India  have\\nsolemnly  resolved  to  constitute India  into  a  sovereign\\ndemocratic  republic  and  to secure  to  all  its  citizens\\njustice, social, economic and political; liberty of thought,\\nexpression belief, faith and worship; equality of status and\\nof opportunity.  These fundamental rights have not been  put\\nin  the Constitution merely for individual  benefit,  though\\nultimately   they   come  into  operation   in   considering\\nindividual rights.  They have been put there as a matter  of\\npublic  policy  and  the  doctrine of  waiver  can  have  no\\napplication to provisions of law which have been enacted  as\\na matter of constitutional policy.\\nReference to some of the Articles, inter alia, Arts. 15 (1),\\nget   discrimination  by  telling  the  State  \\\"   You   can\\ndiscriminate  \\\", or get convicted by waiving the  protection\\ngiven under Arts. 20 and 21.\\\"\\nOn  that  occasion one of us preferred not  to  express  any\\nopinion on this subject and said at page 670:-\\n\\\" In coming to the conclusion that I have, I have in a large\\nmeasure  found  myself  in  agreement  with  the  views   of\\nVenkatarama Aiyar, J., on that part of the case. 1, however,\\ndesire  to  guard myself against being understood  to  agree\\nwith  the  rest  of  the observations to  be  found  in  his\\njudgment,   particularly   those  relating  to   waiver   of\\nunconstitutionality,  the  fundamental rights being  a  mere\\ncheck on legislative power or the effect of the  declaration\\nunder Art. 13(1) being \\\" relatively void \\\". On those  topics\\nI prefer to express no opinion on this occasion.\\\"\\nIt  will, however, be noticed that the observations  of  the\\nlearned  judges  made  in that case did not  relate  to  the\\nwaiver of a breach of the fundamental right under Art. 14.\\nThe  fundamental right, the breach whereof is complained  of\\nby the assessee, is founded on Art. 14 of the  Constitution.\\nThe problem, therefore, before us is whether a breach of the\\nfundamental  right flowing from Art. 14 can be waived.   For\\ndisposing  Of  this  appeal it is not necessary  for  us  to\\nconsider  whether  any  of  the  other  fundamental   rights\\nenshrined  in Part III of our Constitution can or cannot  be\\nwaived.   We take the view that this court should  not  make\\nany  pronouncement  on any question which  is  not  strictly\\nnecessary for the disposal of the particular case before it.\\nWe, therefore, confine our attention to Art. 14 and  proceed\\nto discuss the question on that footing.\\n   Article 14 runs as follows:-\\n\\\"   The State shall not deny to any person  equality  before\\nthe  law  or  the equal protection of the  laws  within  the\\nterritory of India.\\\"\\nIt is the first of the five Articles grouped together  under\\nthe heading \\\" Right to Equality\\\". - The underlying object of\\nthis Article is undoubtedly to secure to\\n                    551\\nall persons, citizen or non-citizens, the equality of status\\nand  of oppotunity referred to in the glorious  preamble  of\\nour  Constitution.  It combines the English doctrine of  the\\nrule  of law and the equal protection T. clause of the  14th\\nAmendment to the American Federal Constitution which enjoins\\nthat   no  State  shall  deny  to  any  person  within   its\\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws \\\". There  can,\\ntherefore,  be  no  doubt or dispute that  this  Article  is\\nfounded  on a sound public policy recognised and  valued  in\\nall  civilised States.  Coming then to the language  of  the\\nArticle it must be noted, first and foremost that this Arti-\\ncle  is, in form, an admonition addressed to the  State  and\\ndoes not directly purport to confer any right on any  person\\nas  some  of  the other Articles, e.g.,  Art.  19,  do.  The\\nobligation  thus imposed on the State, no doubt, enures  for\\nthe  benefit of all persons, for, as a necessary  result  of\\nthe  operation  of  this Article, they  all  enjoy  equality\\nbefore  the  law.  That is, however,  the  indirect,  though\\nnecessary  and  inevitable,  result  of  the  mandate.   The\\ncommand  of  the Article is directed to the  State  and  the\\nreality  of the obligation thus imposed on the State is  the\\nmeasure  of the fundamental right which every person  within\\nthe  territory  of  India is to enjoy.  The  next  thing  to\\nnotice is that the benefit of this Article is not limited to\\ncitizens,  but  is  available  to  any  person  within   the\\nterritory of India.  In the third place it is to be observed\\nthat, by virtue of Art. 12, \\\" the State \\\" which is, by  Art.\\nGovernment  and Parliament of India and the  Government  and\\nthe legislature of each of the States and all local or other\\nauthorities  within  the  territory of India  or  under  the\\ncontrol of the Government of India.  Article 14,  therefore,\\nis  an  injunction to both the legislative as  well  as  the\\nexecutive  organs  of the State and  the  other  subordinate\\nauthorities.  As regards the legislative organ of the State,\\nthe fundamental right is further consolidated and  protected\\nby  the provisions of Art. 13.  Clause (1) of  that  Article\\nprovides that all laws in force in the territories of  India\\nimmediately before the commencement of the Constitution,  in\\nso\\nfar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part III\\nshall, to the extent of the inconsistency be void.  Likewise\\nel. (2) of this Article prohibits the State from making  any\\nlaw which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by the\\nsame  Part and follows it up by saying that any law made  in\\ncontravention  of  this clause Shall, to the extent  of  the\\ncontravention, be void.  It will be observed that- so far as\\nthis  Article  is concerned, there is no relaxation  of  the\\nrestriction  imposed by it such as there are in some of  the\\nother  Articles, e.g., Art. 19, cls. (2) to (6).  Our  right\\nto  equality before the law is thus completely  and  without\\nany  exception secured from all legislative  discrimination.\\nIt  is  not  necessary, for the purpose of  this  appeal  to\\nconsider  whether an executive order is a \\\" law\\\" within  the\\nmeaning of Art. 13, for even without the aid of Art. 13  our\\nright  to  the  equal protection of  the  law  is  protected\\nagainst  the vagaries, if any, of the  executive  Government\\nalso.  In this connection the observations of Lord Atkin  in\\nEshugbayi  Eleko v. Officer Administering the Government  of\\nNigeria  (1)  are apposite.  Said his Lordship at  page  670\\nthat  in accordance with British jurisprudence no member  of\\nthe executive can interfere with the liberty or property  of\\na British subject except when be can support the legality of\\nhis  act  before  a court of justice That  apart,  the  very\\nlanguage  of Art. 14 of the Constitution  expressly  directs\\nthat \\\" the State \\\", which by Art. 12 includes the  executive\\norgan, shall not deny to any person equality before the  law\\nor  the equal protection of the law.  Thus Art. 14  protects\\nus  from  both legislative and executive tyranny by  way  of\\ndiscrimination.\\nSuch  being  the  true  intent and effect  of  Art.  14  the\\nquestion  arises, can a breach of the obligation imposed  on\\nthe  State be waived by any person ? In the face of such  an\\nunequivocal  admonition  administered by  the  Constitution,\\nwhich  is  the supreme law of the land, is it  open  to  the\\nState  to disobey the constitutional mandate merely  because\\n\\u2019a  person  tells  the  State that it may do  so  ?  If  the\\nConstitution asks the State as\\n(1)  L.R. [1931] A,.C. 662.\\nto  why the State did not carry out its behest, will  it  be\\nany  answer for the State to make that \\\" true, you  directed\\nme not to deny any person equality before the law, but  this\\nperson  said that I could do so, for he had no objection  to\\nmy doing it.\\\" I do not think the State will be in any better\\nposition than the positions in which Adam found himself when\\nGod asked him as to why he had eaten the forbidden fruit and\\nthe  State\\u2019s above answer will be as futile as was  that  of\\nAdam  who pleaded that the woman had tempted him and  so  he\\nate  the forbidden fruit.  It seems to us absolutely  clear,\\non  the language of Art. 14 that it is a command  issued  by\\nthe  Constitution to the State as a matter of public  policy\\nwith a view to implement its object of ensuring the equality\\nof status and opportunity which every welfare State, such as\\nIndia,  is by her Constitution expected to do and no  person\\ncan, by any act or conduct, relieve the State of the  solemn\\nobligation  imposed on it by the Constitution.   What.  ever\\nbreach of other fundamental right a person or a citizen  may\\nor  may  not waive, he cannot certainly give up or  waive  a\\nbreach of the fundamental right that is indirectly conferred\\non him by this constitutional mandate directed to the State.\\nThe learned Attorney General has relied on various  passages\\nin  text-books  written by well-known and  eminent  writers,\\ne.g.,  Cooley,  Willoughby, Willis and Rottschaefer  and  on\\neight American decisions.  In considering the statements  of\\nlaw  made  by  American writers  and  judges  the  following\\nobservations  of  Patanjali Sastri, C. J., in The  State  of\\nTravancore-Cocochin  and others v. The Bombay Co.  Ltd.  (1)\\nshould conatantly be borne in mind:-\\nscope and purpose, and a varying body of doctrines and tests\\nhave   grown   around  them   interpreting,   extending   or\\nrestricting,   from  time  to  time,  their  operation   and\\napplication  in  the  context  of  the  expanding   American\\ncommerce  and industry, and we are of opinion that not  much\\nhelp can be derived from them\\n(1)  [1952] S.C.R. 1112,112O, 1121.\\nin  the solution of the problems arising under Art.  286  of\\nthe Indian Constitution.\\\"\\n(See also The State of Bombay v. R.M.D.  Chamarbaugwala(1)).\\nThe  American  authorities  cited by  the  Attorney  General\\nrelate  to  waiver of obligations under a contract,  of  the\\ndeprivation of right to property without due process of  law\\nor  of  the constitutional right to trial by  jury  and  the\\nlike.  They have no bearing on the question of the waiver of\\nthe  equal  protection clause of the 14th  Amendment  which,\\nlike our Art. 14, is a mandate to the State.  It is signifi-\\ncant that no American decision is forthcoming which  upholds\\nthe  waiver  of the breach of that clause.  When a  case  of\\nbreach  of  any of the fundamental rights akin to  what  are\\ndealt  with in the American authorities will come before  us\\nit  will,  then,  be  the  time  for  us  to  discuss  those\\nauthorities  and  to  consider their  applicability  in  the\\nmatter of the interpretation of the corresponding provisions\\nof  our Constitution.  For the moment we prefer  to  confine\\nour observations to a consideration of waiver of the  breach\\nof the fundamental right under Art. 14.\\nLearned  Attorney General has relied on three  decisions  of\\nthis  Court:  (1) Laxmanappa Hanumantappa Jamkhandi  v.  The\\nUnion  of India (2), (2) Dewan Bahadur Seth Gopal Das  Mohta\\nv.  The Union of India (3) and (3) Baburao Narayanrao  Sanas\\nv.  The  Union of India(4) in support of his thesis  that  a\\nbreach  of Art. 14 may well be waived by a person.  In  none\\nof  those cases, all of which were disposed of on  the  same\\nday   (October  21,  1954)  was  the  question   of   waiver\\nspecifically  or  seriously discussed.  As  learned  counsel\\nappearing  for the intervener points out, the first  of  the\\nabove mentioned cases proceeded on the footing that as  Art.\\ncould  not be enforced under Art. 32.  Learned  counsel  for\\nthe  intervener further submitted that the decision  in  the\\nbasis and on -the further ground that proceeding under  Art.\\n(1)  [1957] S.C.R. 874, 918.\\n(3)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 773.\\n(2)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 769\\n(4)  [1954] 26 I.T.R. 725.\\nintended  to  be  used  for  obtaining  relief  against  the\\nvoluntary action of a person and that appropriate remedy for\\nrecovery  of money lay in a suit.  The decision in  the  3rd\\ncase  proceeded  on  the same basis and did  not  carry  the\\nmatter any further.  It is impossible to treat any of  those\\ndecisions  as  representing the considered opinion  of  this\\nCourt  on  the  question  of  waiver  of  a  breath  of  the\\nfundamental  right  under  Art.  14  of  the   Constitution.\\nReference  was also made by the learned Attorney General  to\\nthe  decision of a Single Judge of the Allahabad High  Court\\nin  Subedar v. State (1) where it was held that  Art.  20(3)\\nconferred  merely a privilege and that such privilege  could\\nalways  be waived It was overlooked that if a person  volun-\\ntarily answered any question then there was no breach of his\\nfundamental right at all, for the fundamental right is  that\\na  person  shall not be compelled  to  incriminate  himself.\\nThat  case, therefore, is not a case of waiver at all.   The\\ncase of Pakhar Singh v. The State (2) is also, for the  same\\nreason, not a case of waiver.\\nBe.  (2):  The answer to this question  depends  upon  facts\\nwhich  have not been properly investingated.  The appeal  is\\nagainst the order of the income tax authorities which  order\\nmakes  no  reference  to the plea of  waiver.   Further  the\\nfiling of the statements of case having been dispensed with,\\nwe  have  not had the benefit of the statement of  facts  on\\nwhich  this plea is said to be founded.  The view  taken  on\\nquestion (1), however, relieves us of the necessity of going\\ninto this question.\\nOn  a consideration of the nature of the  fundamental  right\\nflowing from Art. 14, we have no doubt in our mind that  it-\\nis  not  for a citizen or any other person who  benefits  by\\nreason  of  its  provisons  to  waive  any  breach  of   the\\nobligation on the part of the State.  We are, therefore,  of\\nthe  opinion that this appeal should be accepted, the  order\\nof  the  Income Tax Commissioner, Delhi, dated  January  29,\\nfor  implementation  of the order of  the  Union  Government\\ndated July 5, 1954,\\n(1)  A. I. R. 1957 All. 396.\\n(2)  A. 1. R. 1958 Punj. 294.\\nshould  be quashed and that the assessee  appellant,  should\\nget the costs of this appeal.\\nBHAGWATI,  J.-I  agree with the reasoning  adopted  and  the\\nconclusion reached in the judgments prepared by My Lord  the\\nChief  Justice and my brother, S. K. Das, J., in  regard  to\\nthe  ultra vires character of the proceedings adopted  under\\ns. 8-A of the Taxation on Income (Investigation  Commission)\\nAct,  1947  (30  of 1947), and the  void  character  of  the\\nsettlement reached thereunder.  As regards the parts of  the\\njudgments which deal with the question whether a fundamental\\nright guaranteed by the Constitution can be waived at all, I\\nfind  myself in agreement with the judgment prepared  by  my\\nbrother, Subba Rao, J., and am of the opinion that it is not\\nopen to a citizen to waive the fundamental rights  conferred\\nby Part III of the Constitution.\\nThe  question of waiver came to be argued before us in  this\\nway.If the proceedings and the settlement under section  8-A\\nof the Act were void as aforesaid, the respondent  contended\\nthat   the  appellant  had  waived  the  fundamental   right\\nenshrined  in Art. 14 of the Constitution and was  therefore\\nnot entitled to challenge the settlement.  This was only  by\\nway of reply to the contention of the appellant and was  not\\nset  out in proper details in any affidavit filed on  behalf\\nof  the respondent.  The learned Attorney-General,  however,\\nrelied upon the application made by the appellant before the\\nInvestigation  Commission and the contents thereof  as  also\\nthe  payments made by the appellant from time to  time  both\\nbefore and after the pronouncement of our decision in M. Ct.\\nMuthiah  v.  The Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras  (1)  in\\norder  to  support  this plea of waiver  and  the  arguments\\nbefore  us proceeded on that basis.  No objection was  taken\\nby  either of the parties before us to the issue  of  waiver\\nbeing decided on such materials and the question was  argued\\nat  considerable length before us.  The  arguments  moreover\\nextended  to the whole field of fundamental rights and  were\\nnot confined to Art. 14 only.\\n(1)  [1955] 2 S. C. R. 1247.\\n                    557\\nWe,  therefore,  see no reason why we  should  refrain  from\\npronouncing our opinion on that question.\\nThe  preamble to our Constitution, Art. 13 and the  language\\nin  which the fundamental rights have been enacted  lead  to\\none conclusion and one conclusion only that whatever be  the\\nposition  in America, no distinction can be drawn  here,  as\\nhas been attempted in the United States of America,  between\\nthe  fundamental  rights  which may be  said  to  have  been\\nenacted for the benefit of the individual and those  enacted\\nin public interest or on grounds of public policy.  Ours  is\\na  nascent  democracy.  and situated as  we  are,  socially,\\neconomically,  educationally  and  politically,  it  is  the\\nsacred     duty  of  the  Supreme  Court  to   safeguard the\\nfundamental  rights  which  have been  for  the  first  time\\nenacted in Part III of our Constitution.  The limitations on\\nthose  rights have been enacted in the Constitution  itself,\\ne.g., in Arts. 19, 33 and 34.  But unless and until we  find\\nthe  limitations on such fundamental rights enacted  in  the\\nvery   provisions   of  the  Constitution,   there   is   no\\njustification  whatever for importing any notions  from  the\\nUnited  States of America or the authority of cases  decided\\nby  the  Supreme Court there in order to  whittle  down  the\\nplenitude of the fundamental rights enshrined in Part III of\\nour Constitution.\\nThe genesis of the declaration of fundamental rights in  our\\nConstitution can be traced to the following passage from the\\nReport of the Nehru Committee (1928):-\\n\\\" Canada, Australia and South Africa have no declaration  of\\nrights in their Constitutions but there are various articles\\nto  be  found in the Constitution of the  Irish  Free  State\\nwhich  may  properly  be grouped under the  general  head  \\\"\\nfundamental  rights  \\\". The reason for this is  not  far  to\\nseek.   Ireland  is the only country  where  the  conditions\\nobtaining  before  the treaty were the nearest  approach  to\\nthose we have in India.  The first concern of the people  of\\nIreland was, as indeed it is of the people of India  to-day,\\nto secure fundamental rights that have been denied to  them.\\nThe other dominions had their rise from earlier British\\nsettlements  which were supposed to have carried the law  of\\nEngland  with  them.  Ireland was taken and kept  under  the\\nrule of England against her own will and the acquisition  of\\ndominion status by her became a matter of treaty between the\\ntwo  nations.  We conceive that the constitutional  position\\nin India is very much the same.  That India is a  dependency\\nof  Great  Britain cannot be denied.  That position  can  be\\naltered  in one of two ways-force or mutual consent.  It  is\\nthe  latter  in furtherance of which we are called  upon  to\\nrecommend  the principles of a constitution for  India.   In\\ndoing so it is obvious that our first care should be to have\\nour fundamental rights guaranteed in a manner which will not\\npermit their withdrawal under any circumstances.\\\"\\nAt  the Round Table Conference that preceded the  making  of\\nthe  Government of India Act, 1935, therefore,  the,  Indian\\nleaders  pressed  for  a  Bill of  Rights  in  the  proposed\\nConstitution  Act, in order to bind the administration  with\\ncertain  declarations  of  individual  rights.   This   was,\\nhowever,  rejected  by  the  Simon  Commission  with   these\\nobservations:\\n\\\"  We are aware that such provisions have been  inserted  in\\nmany Constitutions, notably in those of the European  States\\nformed  after the War.  Experience, however, has  not  shown\\nthem   to  be  of  any  great  practical  value.    Abstract\\ndeclarations  are  useless unless there exist the  will  and\\nmeans to make them effective.\\\"\\nThe  framers  of  our  Constitution  however  followed   the\\nAmerican  view represented by the famous words of  Jefferson\\nin preference to that expressed by the Simon Commission :-\\n\\\"  The  inconveniences of the declaration are, that  it  may\\ncramp  government in its useful exertions.  But the evil  of\\nthis   is   short-lived,  moderate   and   reparable.    The\\ninconveniences  of the want of a declaration are  permanent,\\nafflictive   and   irreparable.   They   are   in   constant\\nprogression  from  bad  to  worse.   The  executive  in  our\\ngovernments  is not the sole, it is scarcely  the  principal\\nobject  of my jealousy.

To\\nborrow the words of My Lord the Chief Justice \\\" In the  face\\nof   such   unequivocal  admonition  administered   by   the\\nConstitution,  which is the supreme law of the land,  is  it\\nopen  to  the State to disobey  the  Constitutional  mandate\\nmerely because a citizen told the State that it may do so  ?\\nif  the Constitution asks the State as to why the State  did\\nnot  carry  out its behest, will it be any  answer  for  the\\nState to make that \\\" True, you directed me not to take  away\\nor  abridge  the  rights conferred by this  Part,  but  this\\ncitizen said that I could do so, for he had no objection  to\\nmy doing so.\\\" I do not think the State will be in any better\\nposition than the position in which Ad-am found himself when\\nGod asked him as to why he had eaten the forbidden fruit and\\nthe  State\\u2019s above answer will be as futile as that of  Adam\\nwho pleaded that the woman had tempted him and Bo he ate the\\nforbidden  fruit.\\\"  It is absolutely clear on a  perusal  of\\nArt.  13(2) of the Constitution that it is a  constitutional\\nmandate\\nto  the  State  \\u2019and no citizen can by any  act  or  conduct\\nrelieve the State of the solemn obligation imposed on it  by\\nArt. 13(2) and no distinction can be made at all between the\\nfundamental rights enacted for the benefit of the individual\\nand  those enacted in the public interest or on  grounds  of\\npublic policy.\\nWhat  then  is the basis of this distinction  which  has  be\\nstrenuously   urged  before  us  that  there   are   certain\\nfundamental  rights which are enacted only for  the  private\\nbenefit of a citizen, e.g., rights of property, which can be\\nwaived by him and there are other fundamental rights enacted\\nfor the public good or as a matter of public policy which it\\nwould not be open to a citizen to waive even though he  were\\naffected by the breach thereof.  Reliance is placed in  this\\nbehalf  on  certain decisions of the Supreme  Court  of  the\\nUnited  States of America, passages from Willoughby,  Willis\\nand   Rottschaeffer,  quoted  in  the  judgment  of  T.   L.\\nVenkatarama  Aiyar, J., in Behram Khurshed Pesikaka  v.  The\\nState of Bombay (1) and the observations of the said learned\\nJudge in that case adopting the said distinction. (Vide  pp.\\nbe  accepted.  There is nothing in the terms of the  various\\narticles embodying the fundamental rights in Part III of our\\nConstitution   which  warrants  such  a  distinction.    The\\nfundamental  rights  are  enacted  with  all  precision  and\\nwherever  limitations on their exercise are thought of  they\\nare also similarly enacted.  Such constitutional limitations\\nare to be found within the terms of the articles  themselves\\nand  there is no justification for reading in the  terms  of\\nthe  articles  anything more than what is  expressly  stated\\ntherein.   There  is further this  distinction  between  the\\nAmerican  Constitution  and ours that whereas  the  American\\nConstitution  was  merely enacted in order to  form  a  more\\nperfect   union,   establish   justice,   insure    domestic\\ntranquillity,  provide  for  common  defence,  promote   the\\ngeneral welfare and secure the blessings of liberty and  was\\nan outline of government and nothing more, our  Constitution\\nwas\\n(1)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 613.\\n   562\\nenacted  to  secure  to  all  citizens,  justice,  Liberty.\\u2019\\nEquality  and  Fraternity and laid emphasis on  the  welfare\\nstate and contained more detailed provisions,, defining  the\\nrights  and also laying down restrictions thereupon  in  the\\ninterest of the general welfare, etc. -As observed by  Wills\\nin his Constitutional Law at p. 477:-\\n\\\"The  conflict between man and the state is as old as  human\\nhistory.   For  this reason some compromise must  be  struck\\nbetween private liberty and public authority.  There is some\\nneed  of  protecting personal liberty  against  governmental\\npower  and  also some need of limiting personal  liberty  by\\ngovernmental  power.   The ideal situation is  a  matter  of\\nbalancing  one against the other, or  adjusting  conflicting\\ninterests.\\\"\\n\\\" In the United States Constitution an attempt has been made\\nto  strike  a proper balance between  personal  liberty  and\\nsocial control through express limitations written into  the\\nConstitution  and  interpreted  by  the  Supreme  Court,  by\\nimplied limitations created by the Supreme Court, and by the\\ndevelopment of the governmental powers of regulation,  taxa-\\ntion,  and eminent domain by the Supreme Court.\\\"  (Ibid  pp.\\nwhereas our Constitution has expressly sought to strike  the\\nbalance between a written guarantee of individual rights and\\nthe collective interests of the community by making  express\\nprovisions  in that behalf in Part III of the  Constitution.\\n(Vide Gopalan v.

J.,  in  the\\nState of Travancore-Cochin v. The Bombay Co., Ltd. (2).\\n\\\" These clauses are widely different in language, scope  and\\npurpose, and a varying body of doctrines\\n(1) [1950] S.C.R. 88.\\n(2) [1952] S.C.R.1112, 1120\\nand tests have grown around them interpreting, extending  or\\nrestricting,   from  time  to  time,  their  operation   and\\napplication  in  the  context  of  the  expanding   American\\ncommerce  and industry, and we are of opinion that not  much\\nhelp  can  be  derived  from them in  the  solution  of  the\\nproblems arising under Art. 286  of the Indian Constitution\\\"\\nor   for  the  matter  of  that,  articles   embodying   the\\nfundamental rights in Part III of our Constitution (see also\\nThe State of Bombay v. R. M. D. Chamarbaugwala(1)\\nThe  rights conferred on citizens may be thus  classified  :\\n(i) statutory rights; (ii) constitutional rights; and  (iii)\\nfundamental  rights.   One need not consider  the  statutory\\nrights  in  this context but the constitutional  rights  are\\nthose  created and conferred by the Constitution.  They  may\\nor  may not be waived by a. citizen, as stated in  the  text\\nbooks  and the decisions of the Supreme Court of the  United\\nStates  of America above referred to.  But when  the  rights\\nconferred  are  put  on a high pedestal and  are  given  the\\nstatus  of fundamental rights, which though embodied in  the\\nConstitution itself are in express terms distinguished  from\\nthe  other constitutional rights (e.g.,  fundamental  rights\\nwhich are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution and  are\\nenacted as immune from any legislation inconsistent with  or\\nderogatory thereto and other constitutional rights which are\\nenacted  in other provisions, for instance in Arts. 265  and\\nabsolutely  inviolable  save  as expressly  enacted  in  the\\nConstitution  and  cannot  be  waived  by  a  citizen.   The\\nConstitution  adopted by our founding fathers is  sacrosanct\\nand  it is not permissible to tinker with those  fundamental\\nrights  by any ratiocination or analogy of the decisions  of\\nthe Supreme Court of the United States of America.  The only\\nmanner in which that can be done is by appropriate amendment\\nof the Constitution and in no other manner whatever.\\nThere is no difficulty whatever in working out this position\\nand to my mind the difficulties pointed out\\n(1)  [1957] S.C.R. 874, 918.\\nare more imaginary than real.  If a citizen wanted to assert\\nhis fundamental right under the circumstances envisaged  for\\ninstance  in the judgment of my brother S. K. Das,  J.,  and\\nmade an application for a writ under Art. 32 or Art. 226  of\\nthe  Constitution he would be promptly confronted  with  the\\nargument  that  the  Court should in  the  exercise  of  its\\ndiscretion refuse him the relief prayed for.  The remedy  is\\npurely  discretionary  and no Court in  those  circumstances\\nwould  exercise @ its discretion in his favour  (Vide  Dewan\\nBahadur Seth Gopal Das Mohta v. Union of India (1),  Baburao\\nNarayan   Savas   v.  Union  of  India(2)   and   Laxmanappa\\nHoonmantappa Janakhandi v. Union of India (3).  Even then he\\nmight merely obtain a relief declaring the legislation ultra\\nvires the Constitution and the Court would not grant him any\\nconsequential  relief  For  that relief  he  would  have  to\\napproach  the regular courts of law, when all  questions  of\\nlaw, apart from the mere constitutionality of the  provision\\nwould  be considered by the Court on a contest  between  the\\npar. ties, e.g., estoppel, acquiescence, limitation and  the\\nlike (Compare our observations in Sales Tax Officer, Banaras\\nv.  Kanayalal  Mukundlal Saraf (4) ). The only  thing  which\\nparties  would be concluded by would be the adjudication  as\\nto the ultra vire\\u2019s character of the measure in question and\\nthe  citizen  would not be entitled to  the  relief  claimed\\nmerely for the asking.  These considerations, therefore,  do\\nnot  militate  against the position that  a  citizen  cannot\\nwaive the fundamental rights conferred upon him by Part  III\\nof the Constitution.\\nI fully endorse the opinion expressed by Mahajan, C. J.,  in\\nBehram Khursheed Pesikaka v. The State of Bombay (5) at page\\n,,We  think that the rights described as fundamental  rights\\nare  a  necessary  consequence of  the  declaration  in  the\\npreamble that the people of India have solemnly resolved  to\\nconstitute -India into a\\n(1)  [1955] I S.C.R. 773.\\n(3)  [19551 1 S.C.R. 769.\\n(2)  [1954] 26 I.T.R. 725.\\n(4)  Civil  Appeal No. 87 Of 1957 decided on  September  23,\\n(5)  [1955] 1 S.

These fundamental  rights  have\\nnot  been  put  in the Constitution  merely  for  individual\\nbenefit,  though  ultimately  they come  into  operation  in\\nconsidering individual rights.  They have been put there  as\\na  matter  of public policy and the doctrine of  waiver  can\\nhave  no  application to provisions of law which  have  been\\nenacted as a, matter of constitutional policy.\\\"\\nThis,  in  my  opinion is the true position  and  it  cannot\\ntherefore  be urged that it is open to a citizen  to,  waive\\nhis  fundamental  rights  conferred  by  Part  III  of   the\\nConstitution.   The  Supreme  Court is the  bulwark  of  the\\nfundamental  rights  which  have been  for  the  first  time\\nenacted in the Constitution and it would be a, sacrilege  to\\nwhittle  down  those rights in the manner  attempted  to  be\\ndone.\\nThe  result  is however the same and  agree with  the  order\\nproposed by My Lord the Chief Justice.\\nS.   K.  DAS J.-This is an appeal by special leave  from  an\\norder dated January 29, 1958, passed by the Commissioner  of\\nIncome-tax,   Delhi,   respondent  no.  1  before   us,   in\\ncircumstances  which  are somewhat unusual and  out  of  the\\nordinary.   We shall presently relate  those  circumstances;\\nbut  at the very outset it may be stated that two  questions\\nof  far-reaching importance fall for consideration  in  this\\nappeal.   One is the validity of a settlement made under  s.\\nthe  coming  into force of the Constitution on  January  26,\\nthe  Constitution  can be said to have been  waived  by  the\\nappellant in the circumstanoes of this case.\\n\\u2019The  appellant before us is Basheshar Nath, whom  we  shall\\nhereafter call the assessee.  As we have already stated, the\\nCommissioner of Income-tax, Delhi, is the first  respondent,\\nThe second respondent\\nis  the Union of India.  We also allowed the Model  Knitting\\nIndustries, a limited liability Company with its  registered\\noffice  in  Calcutta,  to intervene in the  appeal,  on  the\\nground  that the intervening Company has a case  pending  in\\nthe  High Court of Calcutta where the same questions are  in\\nissue.  We have also heard the intervener in support of  the\\nappeal.\\nOn  behalf of the appellant it has been\\u2019 contended that  the\\nCommissioner of Income-tax, Delhi, is a tribunal within  the\\nmeaning  of  Art,  136 of  the  Constitution  and  exercised\\njudicial  functions  when it passed the  impugned  order  of\\nJanuary  29,  1958.  The respondents pointed  out,  however,\\nthat  the  so-called  order was nothing but  a  reply  which\\nrespondent no.  1 gave to a communication received, from the\\nassessee.  However, the respondents have waived any prelimi-\\nnary objection to the maintainability of the present appeal,\\nand   the  learned  Attorney  General  appearing   for   the\\nrespondents has frankly stated before us that he is  raising\\nno  such preliminary objection, as the Union  Government  is\\nequally  anxious  to have a decision on the  question,  very\\nimportant  from  its  point of view  and  with  far-reaching\\nfinancial  consequences,  as to whether  a  settlement  made\\nunder  s.  8A  of the Act after January 26,  1950,  and  the\\norders passed thereon by the Union Government are valid.  We\\nhave,  therefore, proceeded on the footing that the  present\\nappeal  is competent, and have considered it unnecessary  to\\ndecide  in the abstract the more general question as to  the\\ncircumstances in which an order made by a revenue  authority\\nlike   the  Commissioner  of  Income-tax  partakes  of   the\\ncharacter of A judicial or quasi-judicial order.\\nNow,  for the facts and circumstances which have led  up  to\\nthis  appeal.  The Act received the assent of the  Governor-\\nGeneral  on  April 18, 1947, and came into force on  May  1,\\nreferred  to the Investigation Commission, constitued  under\\ns.  3 of the Act.  The reference was made under s.  5(1)  of\\nthe  Act,  and it ,stated that the  Central  Government  had\\nprima  facie reasons for believing that the assessee  either\\nalone or\\n                    567\\nin  combination  with\\u2019  other  persons  evaded  payment   of\\ntaxation  on income to a substantial extent,  and  therefore\\nthe  case  of  the asseesee was sent  to  the  Investigation\\nCommission  for  investigation and report.   The  period  of\\ninvestigation was from April 1, 1939 to March 31, 1947.  The\\nreport  of the Investigation Commission which has been  made\\navailable to us shows that the case against the assessee was\\nthat he carried on a business of supplying tents,  executing\\ncontract works, and commission agency for some textile mills\\non  a  fairly  extensive scale,  both  individually  and  in\\npartnership  With  his brother.  It appears that  the  total\\nwealth  statement of the assessee was filed on November  10,\\nunder  s. 6(3) of the Act.  From January 8, 1949 to  October\\ncollection  of assessment records of the assessee  from  the\\nincome-tax  authorities  and  of materials  from  the  Civil\\nSupplies  Directorate.   On July 5, 1949, the  total  wealth\\nstatement was received back from the assessee and the order-\\n,sheet  shows  that  on May 26, 1950, (that  is,  after  the\\ncoming  into  force  of  the  Constitution)  the  authorised\\nofficial is-sued a notice to the assessee fixing the hearing\\nfor June 10, 1950.  The assessee then asked for time, and it\\nappears  that for a period of about three years  till  June,\\nheld a preliminary investigation and computed intially  that\\nthe  undisclosed income ,of the assessee for the  period  in\\nquestion   was  Rs.  12,07,000;  on  further  scrutiny   and\\nexamination  of  accounts and after heating  the  assessee\\u2019s\\nexplanation,  the authorised official reduced the amount  in\\nhis  final  report, submitted sometime towards  the  end  of\\nconsidered the report of the authorised official, heard  the\\nassessee,  and came to the conclusion that the total  amount\\nto  be  assessed  in  the hands  of  the  assessee  was  Rs\\u2019\\nInvestigation Commission said:\\n\\\"   During the course of the hearing before us,the  assessee\\nas well as his Auditors applied for a\\nsettlement after admitting liability for the aforesaid  sum.\\nIn  the  circumstances, we consider it proper to  allow  the\\nassessee   the  benefit  of  a  settlement  on   the   lower\\nconcessional basis of 75% of evaded income payable by way of\\ntax and a moderate penalty of Rs, 14,064....... The assessee\\naccepting our findings both as regards the amount of  income\\nthat  escaped assessment and the amount of tax  and  penalty\\npayable, offered a settlement.  In the circumstances, we re-\\ncommend  the acceptance by the Government of the  assessee\\u2019s\\noffer of a settlement.\\\"\\nThe  Central Government accepted the settlement under s.  8A\\nof  the  Act and on July 5, 1954, passed an order  under  s.\\ntax  Officer concerned for a sum of Rs. 3,50,000  (including\\nthe  penalty  of  Rs. 14,064) on the  assessee  and  further\\ndirecting that \\\" all such other proceedings under the Indian\\nIncome-tax Act or under any other law, as may be  necessary,\\nshould be taken with a view to enforcing the payment of  the\\ndemand  and the terms and conditions of settlement.\\\"  Though\\nunder the terms of settlement no instalments were given,  it\\nappears  that the assessee was allowed to pay the amount  at\\nthe rate of Rs. 5,000 per month.  It further appears that up\\nto and including September 8, 1957, the assessee had paid in\\nall a sum of Rs. 1,28,000 towards the demand.  In  December,\\nv. The Commissioner of Income tax, Madras (1), in which  the\\nmajority  of Judges held that s. 5(1) of the Act  was  ultra\\nvires  the  Constitution,  as  it  was  discriminatory   and\\nviolative of the fundamental right guaranteed by Art. 14  of\\nthe Constitution by reason of two amendments which were made\\nin  s. 34 of the Indian Income-tax Act 1922-one in  1948  by\\nthe  enactment of the Income. tax and Business  Profits  Tax\\n(Amendment) Act, 1948 (48 of 1948) and the other in 1954  by\\nthe enactment of the Indian Income-tax (Amendment) Act, 1954\\n(33  of  1954).  Sometime earlier than the  aforesaid  deci-\\nsion, the Income-tax Officer concerned had sent a\\n(1)  [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247,\\n                    569\\nrecovery  certificate to the Collector, New Delhi,  and  the\\nassessee  stated that in execution of the  said  certificate\\nhis  properties  situated  in  Dharamsala  and  Hissar  were\\nattached.   On  December  27, 1957,  the  assessee  filed  a\\npetition  to  the Income-tax Commissioner, Delhi,  in  which\\nafter stating the relevant facts, the assessee claimed that,\\nafter  the  decision in Muthiah\\u2019s case (1),  the  settlement\\nmade under s. 8A of the Act had no force and was not binding\\non   him:  the  assessee  then  prayed  that  the   attached\\nproperties  should  be  released  from  attachment  and  the\\namounts recovered under the terms of settlement refunded  to\\nhim.   On January 29, 1958, the Commissioner  of  Income-tax\\nsent the following reply-\\n\\\"  With reference to your petition dated 27th December  1957\\nregarding  the settlement arrived at under section 8A(2)  of\\nthe Taxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947,\\non you.\\nof  instalments  which  you have not paid  recently  by  5th\\nFebruary,  1958 and also to continue making the payments  in\\naccordance  with the instalments\\u2019 scheme agreed to,  failing\\nwhich  the recovery proceedings will be  vigorously  pursued\\nthrough the usual recovery channels.\\\"\\nThe assessee asked for and obtained special leave from  this\\nCourt  on  February 17, 1958, to appeal from  the  aforesaid\\norder.  In the appeal as orginally filed in pursuance of the\\nspecial  leave granted to the assessee, the  prayer  portion\\nwas  inadvertently  left out.   Subsequently,  the  assessee\\nprayed  that-(a) the report of the Investigation  Commission\\ndated  May 24, 1954, be quashed, (b) the settlement made  on\\nthe  basis  of the report and the directions  given  by  the\\nCentral Government in pursuance thereof and the  proceedings\\nfor  recovery of arrears of tax be all quashed, and (c)  the\\namounts  already  recovered may be ordered to  be  refunded.\\nWith  regard to the last prayer, we may state here  that  it\\nwas not pressed before us and we are relieved from the task,\\nat least in this appeal, of\\n(1)  [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247.\\ndeciding in what circumstances and on what considerations  a\\nrefund of tax voluntarily paid can be claimed.\\nTherefore, the first and foremost question before us is  the\\nvalidity  of the settlement made under S. 8A of  ,-the  Act.\\nOn behalf of the assessee the main argument is that s.  5(1)\\nof  the Act having been held ultra vires  the  Constitution,\\nthe  very  foundation for the report  of  the  Investigation\\nCommission has disappeared and a settlement based thereon is\\nneither  valid,  nor can it be enforced.  On behalf  of  the\\nrespondents, the learned Attorney General has contended that\\nthere  is no decision of this Court which has held  that  s.\\nof  the various sections of the Act, it will be  found  that\\nthere   are   two  separate  and  distinct   procedures   or\\njurisdictions which the Investigation Commission may  follow\\nor  exercise: one is investigation and the other relates  to\\nsettlement.    He  has  submitted  that   the   jurisdiction\\nconferred on the Investigation Commission under s. 8A, which\\nwas inserted in the Act in 1949 by s. 33 of Act 67 of  1949,\\nis  not affected by the decision in Muthiah\\u2019s case (1),  and\\nif   the  Investigation  Commission  had   jurisdiction   to\\nentertain  an application from the assessee for  settlement,\\napprove of the same, and refer it to the Central Government,\\nthe  latter  had also jurisdiction to accept it  under  sub-\\ns.(1) and make necessary orders under sub.s. (2) of s. 8A.In\\nshort, the argument of the learned Attorney General is  that\\nthere is nothing in Muthiah\\u2019s decision (1), which renders s.\\nIt  is  necessary  to  read  at  this  stage  the   relevant\\nprovisions  of  the  Act in so far as  they  bear  upon  the\\nproblems  before  us.  We have said that the Act  came  into\\nforce on May 1, 1947.  This was before the coming into force\\nof  the  Constitution  of  India, and  no  question  of  the\\nviolation  of  any  fundamental  rights  guaranteed  by  the\\nConstitution  arose  on  that date.

Subsection (2) of s. 8 gives  the\\nCentral  Government power to direct reopening of  assessment\\nproceedings  on the report of the  Commission.   Sub-section\\n(4)   states   that  in  the  assessment   or   reassessment\\nproceedings  in pursuance of a direction given under  sub-s.\\n(2), the findings recorded by the Commission shall be final,\\nsubject  to  the provisions of sub-ss.

Section 10, the  last\\nsection, gives the Central Government power to make rules.\\nThe  above  recital  gives a brief conspectus  of  the  main\\nprovisions  of the Act.  It is necessary now to refer  to  a\\nfew  earlier decisions of this Court with regard to some  of\\nthese  provisions.   The earliest in point of  time  is  the\\ndecision  in  Suraj Mall Mohta and Co. v. A.  V.  Viswanatha\\nSastri where sub-s. (4) of S. 5 of the Act and the procedure\\nprescribed  by the Act in so far as it affected the  persons\\nproceeded  against under that sub-section, were held  to  be\\ndiscriminatory  and  therefore void and  unenforceable.   No\\nopinion  was, however, expressed on the validity of s.  5(1)\\nof the Act.\\n(1)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 448.\\nIn  Shree  Meenakshi  Mills  Ltd.,  Madurai  v.  Sri  A.  V.\\nViswanatha  Sastri  (1), it was held that after  the  coming\\ninto  force  on  July 17, 1954,  of  the  Indian  Income-tax\\n(Amendment)  Act, 1954, (33 of 1954) which operated  on  the\\nsame  field as s. 5(1) of the Act, the provisions  of  s.  5\\n(1) became void and unenforceable as being discriminatory in\\ncharacter.   It was further held that when an Act was  valid\\nin  its entirety before the date of the  Constitution,  that\\npart  of the proceedings regulated by the special  procedure\\nand  taken during the pre-Constitution period could  not  be\\nquestioned  how. ever discriminator it might have been,  but\\nthe  discriminatory procedure could not be  continued  after\\nthe  coming  into force of the Constitution.  In  that  case\\n(Meenakshi Mills\\u2019 case(1)) the Investigation Commission  had\\nnot even commenced the proceedings though a period of  seven\\nyears had elapsed and the investigation was pending when the\\nwrit  petitions were filed.  In those circumstances  it  was\\nheld   that   the  proceedings  before   the   Investigation\\nCommission  which had become discriminatory could no  longer\\nbe continued.  Then came the decision in M. CT.  Muthiah  v.\\nThe,  Commissioner  of  Income-tax,  Madras(2).   The  facts\\nrelevant  to  that  decision  were  that  the  Investigation\\nCommission held an enquiry into three cases and submitted  a\\nreport  on August 26, 1952, finding a particular sum  to  be\\nthe undisclosed income during the investigation period.  The\\nCentral  Government accepted the report and passed an  order\\nunder  s.  8(2) of the Act on September 16,  1952.   Notices\\nunder  s. 34 of the Indian Income-tax Act were  then  issued\\nand  reassessments  except  for one year were  made  on  the\\nfindings of the Commission, which were treated as final  and\\nconclusive.   The  re-assessment orders were served  on  the\\nassessees  in February and May 1954.  On December  6,  1954,\\nthe  assessees  filed their writ petitions  challenging  the\\nconstitutionality  of S. 5 (1) of the Act.  It was  held  by\\nthe majority that s. 5 (1) was discriminatory and  violative\\nof  the  fundamental right guaranteed under Art. 14  of  the\\nConstitution,  because s. 34 of the Indian  Income-tax  Act,\\n(1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 787.\\n(2) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247.\\namended  in  1948 operated on the same field  and  from  and\\nafter  January 26, 1950, it included the strip of  territory\\nwhich  was also occupied by s. 5 (1) and  two  substantially\\ndifferent  laws of procedure, one more , prejudicial to  the\\nassessee than the other, could not be allowed to operate  on\\nthe same field in view of the , guarantee of Art. 14 of  the\\nConstitution.  In the result it was held that barring  those\\ncases  which were already concluded by reports made  by  the\\nCommission and directions given by Government before January\\nfor   investigation  as  also  assessment  or   reassessment\\nproceedings which were pending on January 26, 1950, were hit\\nby Art. 14.  The -assessment orders were accordingly quashed\\nas being unconstitutional.\\nNow, we come back to the problems before us: (1) what is the\\neffect of Muthia\\u2019s decision(1) in the present ease, and  (2)\\ndoes  the  Act contemplate two separate  and  distinct,  but\\nseverable,  procedures  or jurisdictions  -one  relating  to\\ninvestigation and the other to settlement, so that the  vice\\nof  discrimination  (if any) attaches to  the  investigation\\nprocedure only and not to the other ?\\nWe  do not see how the learned Attorney General  can  escape\\nfrom  the  position  that Muthia\\u2019s  decision  (1)  holds  in\\nexpress terms that s. 5 (1) of the Act was hit by Art. 14 of\\nthe  Constitution on and after January 26, 1950.  The  ratio\\nof the decision was thus explained in the majority  judgment\\nat page 1260, 1261:-\\n\\\"  After the 8th September, 1948, there were two  procedures\\nsimultaneously  in operation, the one under Act XXX of  1947\\nand the other under the Indian Income tax Act with reference\\nto persons who fell within the same class or category, viz.,\\nthat  of the substantial evaders of income-tax.   After  the\\nthe  class of substantial evaders of income-tax  were  dealt\\nwith  under  the drastic and  summary  procedure  prescribed\\nunder Act XXX of 1947, while other\\n(1)  [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247.\\npersons  who  fell  within the  same  class  of  substantial\\nevaders  of  income-tax  could  be  dealt  with  under   the\\nprocedure  prescribed  in the Indian  Income-tax  Act  after\\nservice of notice upon them under the amended section 34 (1)\\nof  the  Act.  Different persons, though falling  under  the\\nsame class or category of substantial evaders of income-tax,\\nwould, therefore, be subject to different procedures, one  a\\nsummary  and  drastic  procedure  and  the  other  a  normal\\nprocedure  which gave to the assessees various rights  which\\nwere  denied to those who were specially treated  under  the\\nprocedure prescribed in Act XXX of 1947.\\nThe  legislative competence being there,  these  provisions,\\nthough discriminatory, could not have been challenged before\\nthe   advent  of  the  Constitution.   When,  however,   the\\nConstitution came into force on the 26th January, 1950,  the\\ncitizens  obtained the fundamental rights enshrined in  Part\\nIII  of the Constitution including the right to equality  of\\nlaws  and  equal protection of laws enacted  in  article  14\\nthereof,  and  whatever may have been  the  position  before\\nJanuary  26,  1950, it was open to the  persons  alleged  to\\nbelong to the class of substantial evaders thereafter to ask\\nas  to  why some of them were subjected to the  summary  and\\ndrastic  procedure prescribed in Act XXX of 1947 and  others\\nwere subjected to the normal procedure prescribed in section\\nthe procedure prescribed in Act XXX of 1947 being  obviously\\ndiscriminatory and, therefore, violative of the  fundamental\\nright guaranteed under article 14 of the Constitution.\\\"\\nThat ratio is equally applicable in the present case, and if\\ns. 5(1) of the Act is unenforceable after January 26,  1950,\\nthe reference made thereunder against the assessee must also\\nfall after that date and with it must go overboard all  that\\nwas done under the drastic and summary procedure  prescribed\\nunder the Act after January 26,1950.  Two possible arguments\\nthat  (1) substantial evaders whose s were referred  by  the\\nCentral Government for investigation by the Commission\\n                    579\\nbefore  September 1, 1948, formed a class by themselves  and\\n(2)  that proceedings having started before  the  Commission\\nunder a reference valid at the time when it was made  cannot\\nbe  affected by any subsequent amendment of  the  Income-tax\\nArt,  1922,  were  raised, but not accepted  in  Suraj  Mall\\nMohta\\u2019s  Meenakshi  Mills\\u2019  or Muthia\\u2019s case  (1)  (2)  (3).\\nThere  has  been some argument before us as to how  the  two\\nprocedures-one  prescribed under the Income-tax  Act,  1922,\\nand  the other under the Act-compare and contrast with  each\\nother;  but  this is a point which was  canvassed  at  great\\nlength  in  each of the three cases mentioned  above.   This\\nCourt   found  in  unequivocal  terms  that  the   procedure\\nprescribed  under the Act was more summary and drastic,  and\\nin  Suraj  Mall  Mohta\\u2019s case  the  substantial  differences\\nbetween the two procedures were summarised at pp. 463-466 of\\nthe  report.   We do not propose to cover  the  same  ground\\nagain, but cop-tent ourselves with drawing attention to what\\nwas  pointedly said in Suraj Mall Mohta\\u2019s case namely,  that\\nit  was conceded on behalf of Government that the  procedure\\nprescribed by the impugned Act in ss. 6 and 7, which we have\\nread earlier, was more drastic than the procedure prescribed\\nin  ss.  37  and 38 of the Indian Income-tax  Act.   It  was\\nstated   therein  that  though  in  the  first   stages   of\\ninvestigation  there  was some similarity  between  the  two\\nprocedures, the overall picture was not the same.\\nThe learned Attorney General has not seriously contested the\\ncorrectness  of this position, but has argued that  what  we\\nare  concerned  with  in the present case is  not  the  mere\\npossibility  of a differential treatment, but what  actually\\nwas  done  by  the Commission in the  case  of  the  present\\nassessee after January 26, 1950.  He has submitted that  the\\nassessee was not subjected to any differential treatment  in\\nfact,  and has invoked to his aid the ratio of our  decision\\nin Syed Qasim Razvi v. The State of Hyderabad (4), where the\\nmajority  judgment laid down the following tests: in a  case\\nwhere part of the trial cannot be challenged as\\n(1) [1955] 1S.C.R.448\\n(2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 787.\\n(3)  [1955) 2 S.C.R. 1247.\\n(4)  [1953] S.C.R. 589.\\nbad, it is incumbent on the court to consider, first whether\\nthe  discriminatory provisions of the law can  be  separated\\nfrom  the  rest  and even without them  a  fair  measure  of\\nequality  in  the matter of procedure can  be  secured,  and\\nsecondly,  whether the procedure -actually followed \\u2019did  or\\ndid  not, proceed upon the discriminatory provisions and  it\\nwas  stated  that a; mere threat or possibility  of  unequal\\ntreatment  was not sufficient to invalidate  the  subsequent\\nproceedings.   A  reference was there made  to  the  earlier\\ndecisions,  of this Court in Keshavan Madhava Xenon  v.  The\\nState  of Bombay (1), and Lachmandas Kewalram Ahuja  v.  The\\nState  of Bombay (2 ), and the decision in  Lachmandas  case\\n(supra), again a majority decision, was distinguished on two\\ngrounds: first, the question as to whether after eliminating\\nthe  discriminatory  provisions  it was  still  possible  to\\nsecure a fair measure of equality with the normal  procedure\\nwas neither raised nor considered ; secondly, it was assumed\\nthat  it was not possible to proceed with the trial  without\\nfollowing the discriminatory procedure and as that procedure\\nbecame  void on the coming into force of  the  Constitution,\\nthe jurisdiction to proceed under that procedure came to  an\\nend.  Applying the tests laid down in the majority  decision\\nof Syed Qasim Razvi\\u2019s case (3), the learned Attorney General\\nhas  contended that in the present case  the  discriminatory\\nprovisions  can be separated from the rest of the  Act,  and\\nthe assessee was not in fact subjected to any discriminatory\\nprocedure.   He has sought to distinguish Muthia\\u2019s  case  on\\nthe same ground, viz., that the re-assessments made in  that\\ncase were actually based on a discriminatory procedure.\\nIn our view the ratio of the majority decision in Syed Qasim\\nRazvi\\u2019s  case (3) has no application in the case  under  our\\nconsideration,  and the principle which applies is what  was\\nlaid down in Lachmandas\\u2019s case (2). The majority decision is\\nSyed  Qasim Razvi\\u2019s case proceeded on the finding (to  quote\\nthe  words  of  Mukherjea, J., who  delivered  the  majority\\njudgment)  that \\\" although there were deviations in  certain\\nparticulars,\\n(1) [1951] S. C. R. 228.           (2) [1952] S. C. R. 71O.\\n(.3) [1953] S. C. R. 589.\\n                    581\\nthe  accused  had  substantially the  benefit  of  a  normal\\ntrial\\\".   The minority judgments, however, very  pertinently\\npointed  out  that  the discriminatory  provisions  were  an\\nintegral  part  of the Regulation under  which  the  accused\\nperson in that case was tried and in fact the discriminatory\\nprovisions were applied.  Bose, J. (as he then was expressed\\nthe  view  (at p. 618) \\\" that in testing the validity  of  a\\nlaw,  it is irrelevant to consider what has been done  under\\nit,  for  a  law is either constitutional  or  not  and  the\\nvalidity  or  otherwise  cannot depend upon  what  has  been\\naccomplished under its provisions.\\\"\\nIt  is,  we think, unnecessary to go  into  the  controversy\\nwhich arises out -of the two views expressed above.  For the\\npresent  case,  it  is  sufficient  to  say  that  (1)   the\\ndiscriminatory  provisions  are  an  integral  part  of  the\\nprocedure prescribed under the Act which cannot be separated\\nfrom  the  rest; and (2) we are satisfied  that  the  report\\nwhich  led to the settlement was made by  the  Investigation\\nCommission  in  pursuance of and as a direct result  of  the\\ndiscriminatory  procedure  which it followed.   Indeed,  the\\nInvestigation  Commission  followed the  only  procedure  of\\ninvestigation prescribed under the Act, which was a  drastic\\nand summary procedure, and if that procedure became void  on\\nthe coming into force of the Constitution, the  jurisdiction\\nof  the Investigation Commission practically came to an  end\\n(see Lachmandas\\u2019s case, supra).\\nIt  is  necessary to explain here why we cannot  accept  the\\ncontention  of the learned Attorney General that  there  are\\ntwo procedures or two jurisdictions under the Act.  What  in\\nsubstance is the effect of the provisions of the Act, in  so\\nfar as they relate to the Commission\\u2019s duty under s. 3  (b)?\\nThe  Commission  receives a reference under s. 5 (1)  if  it\\ndoes  not proceed under s. 5 (2), it exercises such  of  its\\npowers  under  s.  6 as it  considers  necessary.   It  then\\nfollows  the  procedure laid down in s. 7  and  submits  its\\nreport  under s. 8. On that report, the  Central  Government\\ntakes  action  under s. 8 (2).  If,  however,  the  assessee\\napplies  for settlement, even then the Commission  has  the,\\nduty to report to Government if the terms of settlement are\\napproved  by it.  To fulfil this duty, the  Commission  must\\nget the materials by exercising its powers under s. 6 and by\\nfollowing  the procedure laid down in s. 7. That is  exactly\\nwhat  was done in the present case.  An authorised  official\\nwas  asked to examine the accounts etc. under s. 6 (3).   He\\nexamined  the  accounts and submitted an interim  report  in\\nregard to inspection of documents, examination of  witnesses\\netc.  He then submitted a final report.  The Commission then\\nheard the assesee on May 19, 1954, and reserved orders.   On\\nMay 20, 1954, after the assessee knew what the final finding\\nof  the Commission was going to be, he filed an  application\\nfor  settlement.  The Commission made its final report  four\\ndays  after.   It  is difficult to  understand  how  in  the\\ncircumstances  stated  above,  it  can  be  said  that   the\\nCommission  followed a non-discriminatory procedure or  that\\nit  had two jurisdictions-one relating to investigation  and\\nthe  other to settlement.  The jurisdiction was really  one,\\nand  the  procedure followed also the same.  It  is  not  as\\nthough the Act provided a separate procedure for purposes of\\neffecting  a  settlement;  nor  is  this  a  case  where   a\\nsettlement  has  been  made  without  applying  any  of  the\\nprovisions relating to investigation.  A full  investigation\\nwas  made, and after the assessee had been subjected to  the\\ndrastic  and  summary procedure under the Act, he  was  told\\nwhat the result of the investigation was.  Then, he made  an\\napplication  for  settlement,  which  was  approved  by  the\\nCommission under s. 8A.\\nWe  are  accordingly of the view that the  learned  Attorney\\nGeneral  has failed to make out his case that  (1)  Muthia\\u2019s\\ndecision (1) does not apply and (2) the settlement under  s.\\nseverability   or  non-application  of  the   discriminatory\\nprocedure under the Act in the case of the assessee..\\nThis  brings me to the second question, that of waiver of  a\\nfundamental  right, which is as important as it is  complex.\\nIt is a question on which unfortunately we\\n(1) [1955] 2 S.C.R.1247.\\nhave  not been able to achieve unanimity.  It is beset  with\\nthis initial difficulty that the present appeal is not  from\\na  judgment  or order rendered after the trial  of  properly\\nframed issues; it is from an order which merely rejected the\\nprayer  of  the  assessee that his  properties  attached  in\\nexecution of the recovery certificate should be released and\\nthe amounts paid under the terms of the settlement refunded.\\nThe  question of waiver was neither raised, nor  tried;  and\\nthe  necessary facts were not ascertained or  determined  by\\nthe revenue authority concerned.  Unfortunately, the  filing\\nof  a  statement  of  their case by  the  parties  was  also\\ndispensed  with,  the  result  whereof  has  been  that  the\\nquestion of waiver has been urged for the first time in  the\\ncourse  of  arguments here.  We have,  however,  heard  full\\narguments  on  it,  and  proceed  to  consider  it  on  such\\nmaterials as have been placed before us.  It is necessary to\\nmake one point clear.  The respondents have raised the  plea\\nof  waiver, and the onus lies heavily on them  to  establish\\nthe essential requirements in support of the plea.\\nTwo   points  arise  in  this  connection:  (1)   have   the\\nrespondents  established,  on the materials before  us,  the\\nnecessary  facts on which a plea of waiver can be founded  ;\\nand  (2)  if so, can a fundamental right guaranteed  by  the\\nConstitution  be  waived  at all.  If  the  first  point  is\\nanswered  in  the  negative, the second point  need  not  be\\nanswered in the abstract.  On behalf of the respondents,  it\\nhas  been submitted that assuming (without  conceding)  that\\nthe discriminatory provisions of the Act were applied in the\\ncase  of the assessee before he asked for a settlement,  the\\nmaterials  on  record -show that he never  objected  to  the\\nprocedure  adopted, voluntarily asked for a settlement,  got\\nby the settlement the benefit. of reducing his liability for\\nboth  tax and penalty, and paid without demur the  following\\ninstalments (some even after Muthia\\u2019s decision (1) )\\n(1)  [1955] 2 S.C.P. 1247.\\n    Payments made up to April 55         10,000\\n    Payment made on      10-5-55          5,000\\n                  19-6-55          5,000\\n                   7-7-55          5,000\\n                  13-8-55          5,OOO\\n                   7-9-55          5,000\\n                  15-10-55         5,000\\n                  10-11-55         5,000\\n                  15-12-55         5,000\\n                   8-2-56          5,000\\n                  13-2-56          5,000\\n                   7-3-56          5,000\\n                  14-5-56          5,000\\n                  19-5-56          5,000\\n                  13-6-56          5,000\\n                   6-8-56          5,000\\n                   7-9-56          5,000\\n                   9-10-56         5,000\\n                  10-11-56         5,000\\n                  23-12-56         5,000\\n                  14-1-57          5,000\\n                  29-3-57          5,000\\n                   4-6-57          5,000\\n                   8-9-57          8,000\\n                                ----------\\n                                 1,28,000\\n                                -----------\\nThe  learned  Attorney  General  has  in  this-   connection\\nreferred  us  to the application for  settlement  which  the\\nassessee  had made to the Commission, wherein the  following\\nstatements were made:-\\n\\\"  in view of the fact that though no  disclosure  statement\\nhad  been made before the submission of his reports  by  the\\nauthorised  official,, still during the enquiry  before  the\\nCommission,,  the assessee and his auditors  admitted  their\\nliability  to  tax in respect of the aforesaid  sum  of  Rs.\\nassessee  should be granted the benefit of a  settlement  on\\nthe  lower concessional basis of payment of 75 per cent.  of\\nthe  undisclosed income by way of tax.  The  Commission  was\\nalso  of the opinion that the assessee should pay by way  of\\npenalty a sum of Rs. 14,064.\\n                    585\\nThe  assessee accepts the conclusions of the  Commission  as\\nregards  the amount of income that escaped  assessment,  the\\ntax payable thereon and the penalty payable as aforesaid.\\\"\\nOn  the  basis  of these statements,  the  learned  Attorney\\nGeneral  has  argued  that there is no  foundation  for  the\\nsuggestion   made  on  behalf  of  the  assessee  that   the\\napplication for settlement was made \\\" under the pressure  of\\ncircumstances  and in view of the coercive machinery of  the\\nAct.\\\" He has submitted that the necessary facts on which the\\nplea of waiver is founded have been established, and he  has\\nrelied on three cases decided by this Court, where according\\nto him the effect of the decisions was to accept such a plea\\nin circumstances very similar: Dewan Bahadur Seth Gopal  Das\\nMohta v. The Union of India(1); Baburao Narayanrao Sanas  v.\\nThe   Union  of  India  (2);  and  Laxnanappa   Hanumantappa\\nJamkhandi  v.  The  Union  of India (3)  On  behalf  of  the\\nassessee, it is contended on the contrary that the necessary\\nfacts  to found a plea of waiver are totally absent  in  the\\npresent  case,  and none of the  aforesaid  three  decisions\\nwhich were all pronounced on the same day proceed on a  plea\\nof waiver.\\nTwo  of  the three decisions referred to above relate  to  a\\nsettlement  made under s. 8A and the third to an order  made\\nunder  s.  8(2) of the Act.  All the  three  decisions  were\\npronounced  on  applications  made  under  Art.  32  of  the\\nConstitution,  and  not on any appeal from an order  of  the\\nrevenue  authority.   In  Gopal Das  Mohta\\u2019s  case  (1)  the\\nargument  urged was, inter alia, that ss. 5, 6, 7 and  8  of\\nthe Act were invalid and ultra vires as they contravened the\\nprovisions  of  Arts.  14,  19  (1)  (f),  and  31  of   the\\nConstitution  and  the  prayer  made  was  that  the  entire\\nproceedings should be quashed as also all orders made by the\\nCentral  Government in pursuance of the settlement under  s.\\nwho delivered the , judgment of the Court said at p. 776-\\n(1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 773.         (2) [1954] 26 I.T.R. 725.\\n(3)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 769.\\n\\\"  In  our judgment this petition  is  wholly  misconceived.\\nWhatever tax the petitioner has already paid, or whatever is\\nstill recoverable from him, is being recovered on the  basis\\nof  the  settlement  proposed by him  and  accepted  by  the\\nCentral Government.  Because Of his request for a settlement\\nno assessment was made against him by following the whole of\\nthe  -procedure  of the Income-tax Act.  In  this  situation\\nunless  and  until  the petitioner can  establish  that  his\\nconsent  was  improperly procured and that he is  not  bound\\nthereby  he  cannot  complain that any  of  his  fundamental\\nrights  has been contravened for which he can  claim  relief\\nunder  art.  32 of the Constitution.  Article 32  of  \\u2019,,the\\nConstitution   is  not  intended  for  relief  against   the\\nvoluntary actions of a person.  His remedy, if any, lies  in\\nother appropriate proceedings.\\\"\\nThere  has been a good deal of argument before us as to  the\\ntrue  effect of the decision in Gopal Das Mohta\\u2019s case  (1).\\nWhile  I recognise that the reason stated for the  decision,\\nviz.,  that  Art.  32 is not  intended  for  relief  against\\nvoluntary  actions  of a person, comes very near  to  saying\\nthat  a  person has waived his protection in  a  given  case\\nsince  whatever  injury he may incur is due to his  own  act\\nrather  than  to  the  enforcement  of  an  unconstitutional\\nmeasure  against him, I am unable to hold that the  decision\\nproceeded strictly on the doctrine of waiver; it is  perhaps\\ntrue  to say that some of the observations made therein  are\\nof a \\\" Delphic nature to be translated into concreteness  by\\nthe process of litigating elucidation\\\" (to borrow the  words\\nof Frankfurter, J., in Machinists v. Gonzales (2).  It seems\\nto  me  that the decision proceeded more upon the  scope  of\\nArt. 32 than upon the doctrine of waiver.  I am fortified in\\nthis view by the circumstance that in a decision given  only\\na  month earlier (see Behram Khurshed Pesikaka v. The  State\\nof  Bombay  (3)) the same learned  Chief  Justice  expressed\\nhimself strongly, though tentatively, against introducing in\\nour  Constitution  the doctrine of waiver as  enunciated  by\\nsome   American   Judges   in   construing   the    American\\nConstitution, without a full discussion of the matter.   The\\nreport of Gopal\\n(1) [1955] 1 S.C.P. 773.       (2) (1958) 356 U.S. 617,619\\n(3) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 613 653,654.\\nDas  Mohta\\u2019s case (1) does not contain any reference to  the\\ndoctrine  of  waiver,  and it is  obvious  that  no  ,fuller\\ndiscussion  of the doctrine took place in that case.  It  is\\nnot, therefore, reasonable to hold that the effect of  Gopal\\nDas Mohta\\u2019s case is to uphold the doctrine of waiver.   Babu\\nRao\\u2019s case (2) merely followed Gopal Das Mohta (1) and  gave\\nno separate reasons.  Laxmanappa Jamkhandi\\u2019s case (3)  dealt\\nwith an order under s. 8(2) of the Act and said at p. 772:-\\n\\\"  From  the  facts  stated  above  it  is  plain  that  the\\nproceedings  taken  under  the  impugned  Act  XXX  of  1947\\nconcluded   so  far  as  the  Investigation  Commission   is\\nconcerned  in  September, 1952, more than two  years  before\\nthis  petition was presented in this Court.  The  assessment\\norders under the Income-tax Act itself were made against the\\npetitioner in November, 1953.  In these circumstances we are\\nof  the opinion that -he is entitled to no relief under  the\\nprovisions  of Article 32 of the Constitution.  It was  held\\nby  this Court in Ramjilal v. Income-tax Officer,  Mohindar-\\ngarh,  [1951]  S.C.R. 127, that as there is a  special  pro.\\nvision in Article 265 of the Constitution, that no tax shall\\nbe  levied or collected except by authority of  law,  clause\\n(1)  of Article 31 must therefore be regarded  as  concerned\\nwith   deprivation  of  property  otherwise  than   by   the\\nimposition  or collection of tax, and inasmuch as the  right\\nconferred  by Art. 265 is not a right conferred by Part  III\\nof the Constitution, it could not be enforced under  Article\\npetition  under  Article  32  is  not  maintainable  in  the\\nsituation  that  has arisen and that even otherwise  in  the\\npeculiar circumstances that have arisen it would not be just\\nand proper to direct the issue of any of the writs the issue\\nof which is discretionary with this Court.\\\"\\nHere,  again,  there  is no reference  to  the  doctrine  of\\nwaiver,  and the case was decided on the ambit and scope  of\\nArt. 32 of the Constitution.\\nI  would hold, therefore, that the decisions of  this  Court\\nrelied on by the learned Attorney General do\\n(1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 773.        (2) [1954] 26 I.T.R. 725.\\n(3)[1955] 1 S.C.R.769.\\nnot help him in establishing waiver.  Let me now examine the\\ncircumstances  on which the learned Attorney General  founds\\nhis  plea of waiver.  Indeed, it is true that  the  assessee\\nsubmitted to the discriminatory procedure applied to him  by\\nthe  Commission; he also asked for a settlement under  which\\nhe  agreed  to pay 75% of his alleged tax  liability  and  a\\nsmall amount of penalty; he made some payment in instalments\\neven  after Muthia\\u2019s decision in December, 1955.   Do  these\\ncircumstances amount to waiver ? It is to be remembered that\\nin  1953-1954 when the discriminatory procedure of  the  Act\\nwas  applied to him and the report against him was  made  by\\nthe  Commission  on  which  the  settlement  is  based,  the\\nassessee  did not know, nor had it been declared by a  court\\nof competent jurisdiction that s. 5(1) of the Act was  ultra\\nvires.  In his application for a settlement, he said clearly\\nin  paragraph  3 that the Commission announced - it  as  its\\nview  that  the income, profits and gains that  had  escaped\\nassessment  in the hands of the assessee was  Rs.  4,47,915.\\nThe  assessee also knew that under the Act this finding  was\\nfinal  and binding on him.  If in these  circumstances,  the\\nassessee made an application for settlement, can it be  said\\nthat  it is a voluntary or intentional relinquishment  of  a\\nknown right ? I venture to think not.  It has been said that\\n\\u2019  waiver\\u2019 is a troublesome term in the law.  The  generally\\naccepted connotation is that to constitute \\u2019 waiver\\u2019,  there\\nmust  be an intentional relinquishment of a known  right  or\\nthe  voluntary  relinquishment  or abandonment  of  a  known\\nexisting  legal  right,  or  conduct  such  as  warrants  an\\ninference  of  the  relinquishment  of  a  known  right   or\\nprivilege.   Waiver differs from estoppel in the sense  that\\nit  is contractual and is an agreement to release or not  to\\nassert a right; estoppel is a rule of evidence. (See  Dawson\\nBank  Limited v. Nippon Menkwa Kabushiki Kaisha) (1).   What\\nis  the known legal right which the  assessee  intentionally\\nrelinquished or agreed to release in 1953-1954 ? He did  not\\nknow then that any part of the Act was invalid, and I  doubt\\nif in\\n(1) (1935) L.R.62 I.A.100,108.\\n                    589\\nthe  circumstances of this case, a plea of \\u2019waiver\\u2019  can  be\\nfounded on the maxim of \\u2019ignorance of law is no excuse\\u2019.   I\\ndo not think that the maxim \\u2019ignorance of law is no  excuse\\u2019\\ncan  be  carried to the extent of saying that  every  person\\nmust be presumed to know that a piece of legislation enacted\\nby  a legislature of competent jurisdiction must be held  to\\nbe-invalid, in case it prescribes a differential  treatment,\\nand he must, therefore, refuse to submit to it or incur  the\\nperil  of the bar of waiver being raised against him.  I  do\\nnot think that such pre-science is a necessary corollary  of\\nthe maxim.  On the contrary, the presumption, if any,  which\\noperated at the relevant time was the presumption that a law\\npassed by a competent legislature is valid, unless  declared\\nunconstitutional  by  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction.\\nFurthermore, I do not think that any inference of waiver can\\nbe retrospectively drawn from the instalments paid in  1956-\\nalready paid is no longer a live issue before us.  It would,\\nI  think, be going too far to hold that  every  unsuspecting\\nsubmission  to a law, subsequently declared to  be  invalid,\\nmust  give  rise  to  a plea  of  waiver:  this  would  make\\nconstitutional  rights  depend  for their  vitality  on  the\\naccident of a timely challenge and render them illusory to a\\nvery large extent.\\nI  hold,  therefore,  that  the  necessary  foundation   for\\nsustaining  the  plea of waiver has not been  laid  in  this\\ncase,  and the onus being on the respondents, the plea  must\\nfail.\\nIn view of my finding that the necessary foundation on facts\\nfor sustaining the plea of waiver has not been laid in  this\\ncase, it becomes unnecessary to decide, in the abstract, the\\nfurther  question  if  a  right guaranteed  by  any  of  the\\nprovisions in Part III of the Constitution can be waived  at\\nall.   I  am of the view -that this Court should  indeed  be\\nrigorous  in avoiding to pronounce on constitutional  issues\\nwhere  a  reason.  able  alternative  exists;  for  we  have\\nconsistently  followed  the two principles (a)  that  \\\"  the\\nCourt  will not anticipate a question of constitutional  law\\nin\\nadvance  of  the  necessity  of deciding  it  \\\"  (Weaver  on\\nConstitutional  Law,  p. 69) and (b) \\\" the  Court  will  not\\nformulate  a  rule  of constitutional law  broader  than  is\\nrequired by the precise facts to which it is to be applied \\\"\\n(ibid, p. 69).\\nMy Lord the Chief Justice and my learned brother Kapur,  J.,\\nhave  however expressed the view that the fundamental  right\\nguaranteed  under  Art.  14 cannot  be  waived;  my  learned\\nbrethren,  Bhagwati and Subba Rao, JJ., have  expressed  the\\nview  that none of the fundamental rights guaranteed by  the\\nConstitution can be waived.\\nI  greatly  regret  to have to say that I  have  come  to  a\\nconclusion  different  from  theirs  with  regard  to   this\\nquestion,  and  as they have thought fit  to  express  their\\nviews  on  it  proceed now to explain why I have come  to  a\\nconclusion  different from those of my learned  brethren  on\\nthis question.\\nThis  question  was mooted, though not  fully  answered,  in\\nBehram Khurshed Pesikaka\\u2019s case (1).  Venkatarama Aiyar, J.,\\nexpressed  his  views  at pages 638 to 643  of  the  report.\\nMahajan, C. J., with whom Mukherjea, Vivian Bose and  Ghulam\\nHasan,  JJ., concurred, expressed his views at pages 651  to\\nreserved  his  opinion  on the  question.   The  view  which\\nVenkatarama   Aiyar,   J.,  expressed  was  this:   if   the\\nconstitutional  provision which has been  infringed  affects\\nthe competence of the legislature which passed the law,  the\\nlaw is a nullity; as for example, when a State enacts a  law\\nwhich is within the exclusive competence of the Union; when,\\nhowever,  a law is within the competence of the  legislature\\nwhich passed it and the unconstitutionality arises by reason\\nof  its repugnancy to provisions enacted for the benefit  of\\nindividuals,   it   is  not  a  nullity,   but   is   merely\\nunenforceable; such unconstitutionality can be waived and in\\nthat  case  the law becomes enforceable.  He  said  that  in\\nAmerica  this principle was well settled and he referred  to\\nCooley on Constitutional Limitations, Volume 1, pages 368 to\\n(1)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 613, 653, 654.\\npages 524, 531, 542 and 558; Rottschaefer on  Constitutional\\nLaw  at  pages 28 and 29-30.  He then  referred  to  certain\\nAmerican decisions in support of his views and then said:-\\n\\\" The position must be the same under our Constitution  when\\na law contravenes a prescription intended for the benefit of\\nindividuals............  It  is  open to  any  person  whose\\nrights  have  been infringed to waive it and when  there  is\\nwaiver,  there is no legal impediment to the enforcement  of\\nthe law.  It will be otherwise if the statute was a nullity;\\nin  which  case it can neither be waived nor  enforced.   If\\nthen  the  law is merely unenforceable and can  take  effect\\nwhen waived, it cannot be treated as non est and as effaced\\nout of the statute book.\\\"\\nThe  contrary view expressed by Mahajan, C. J., can be  best\\nexplained in his own words:\\n\\\"  We  think  that  it is not  a  correct  proposition  that\\nconstitutional  provisions in Part III of  our  Constitution\\nmerely  operate  as a check on the exercise  of  legislative\\npower.   It is axiomatic that when the lawmaking power of  a\\nState  is restricted by a written fundamental law, then  any\\nlaw  enacted and opposed to fundamental law is in excess  of\\nthe legislative authority and is thus a nullity.  Both these\\ndeclarations  of unconstitutionality go to the root  of  the\\npower itself and there is no real distinction between  them.\\nThey represent but two aspects of want of legislative power.\\nThe  legislative  power  of the  Parliament  and  the  State\\nlegislatures  as  conferred  by Arts. 245  and  246  of  the\\nConstitution  stands  curtailed by  the  fundamental  rights\\nchapter of the Constitution.  \\\"\\nHis  Lordship then referred to Art. 13 of  the  Constitution\\nand said that it was a clear and unequivocal mandate of  the\\nfundamental  law prohibiting the State from making any  laws\\nwhich came into conflict with Part III of the  Constitution.\\nHis Lordship added:\\n\\\" In our opinion the doctrine of, waiver enunciated by  some\\nAmerican  Judges  in construing  the  American  Constitution\\ncannot  be introduced in our Constitution without  a  fuller\\ndiscussion of the matter......... Without finally expressing\\nan opinion on this question, we\\nare  not for the moment convinced that this theory  has  any\\nrelevancy in construing the fundamental rights conferred  by\\nPart  III  of the Constitution.  We think  that  the  rights\\ndescribed as fundamental rights are a necessary  consequence\\nof the declaration in the ,preamble that the people of India\\nhave solemnly resolved to constitute India into a  sovereign\\ndemocratic  republic  and  to secure  to  all  its  citizens\\njustice, social, economic and political; liberty of thought,\\nexpression,  belief, faith and worship; equality  of  status\\nand of opportunity.  These fundamental rights have not  been\\nput  in  the  Constitution merely  for  individual  benefit,\\nthough  ultimately they come into operation  in  considering\\nindividual rights.  They have been put there as a matter  of\\npublic  policy  and  the doctrine of  waiver  can,  have  no\\napplication to provisions of law which have been enacted  as\\na matter of constitutional policy.\\\"\\nIt would appear that the two main reasons which Mahajan,  C.\\nJ.,  gave  in  support of the views expressed  by  him  were\\nthese.   Firstly, he held that the effect of Art. 13 of  the\\nConstitution was to prohibit the State from making any  laws\\nwhich  came into conflict with Part III of the  Constitution\\nand  he  recognised  no such distinction  as  was  drawn  by\\nVenkatarama Aiyar, J., between absence of legislative  power\\n(that   is,  incompetence  of  the  legislature)  and   non-\\nobservance of provisions which operate merely as a check  on\\nthe exercise of legislative power.  He thought that  absence\\nof  legislative  power and check on the exercise  of  legis-\\nlative power were both aspects of want of legislative power.\\nSecondly, he referred to the preamble and the scheme of Part\\nIII  of  the Constitution in support of his  view  that  the\\ndoctrine  of  waiver  did not  apply.   I  shall  take-these\\nreasons in the order in which I have stated them.\\nFirst,  as  to the effect of Art. 13  of  the  Constitution.\\nArticle 13 is in two parts: the first part deals with \\\"  all\\nlaws  in force in the territory of India immediately  before\\nthe commencement of this Constitution \\\"\\u2019and says that so far\\nas  such laws are inconsistent with the provisions  of  Part\\nIII, they shall to the extent of such\\ninconsistency be void; the second part deals with laws  made\\nafter  the commencement of the Constitution and says that  \\\"\\nthe  State  shall  not make any law  which  takes.  away  or\\nabridges  the  rights  conferred  by  Part  III  \\\"  of   the\\nConstitution and any law made in contravention of cl. (2) of\\nArt.  13 shall to the extent of  the contravention  be void.\\nIt seems clear to me that the Article itself recognises  the\\ndistinction between absence of legislative power which  will\\nmake the law made by an incompetent legislature wholly void,\\nand  exercise  of legislative power in  contravention  of  a\\nrestriction or check on such power, which will make the  law\\nvoid  to the extent of the inconsistency  or  contravention.\\nThe use, of the words \\\" to the extent of the inconsistency \\\"\\nand  \\\"  to  the extent of the  contravention  \\\"  indubitably\\npoints  to such a distinction, and indeed this  was  pointed\\nout in Bhikaji Narain Dhakras v. The State of Madhya Pradesh\\n(1).   This  was  an unanimous decision of  this  Court  and\\nseveral earlier decisions including the decision in  Kesavan\\nMadhava Menon\\u2019s case (2), on which Mahajan, C. J., placed so\\nmuch  reliance,  were considered therein.  The  decision  in\\nBehram  Khurshed Pesikaka (3)was also considered,  and  then\\nthe following observations were made with regard to Art.  13\\nof the Constitution at p. 598-\\n\\\" Article 13(1) by reason of its language cannot be read  as\\nhaving obliterated the entire operation of the  inconsistent\\nlaw or having wiped it out altogether from the statute book.\\nSuch   law  existed  for  all  past  transactions  and   for\\nenforcement  of  rights and liabilities accrued  before  the\\ndate  of the Constitution, as was held in  Keshavan  Madhava\\nMenon\\u2019s  case.   The law continued in force even  after  the\\ncommencement  of the Constitution, with respect  to  persons\\nwho  were not citizens and could not claim  the  fundamental\\nright.  In short, Art. 13(1) had the effect of nullifying or\\nrendering  the  existing law which had  become  inconsistent\\nwith  Art.  19(1)(g)  read with el.

The  same  distinction  was  again\\nreferred  to in another unanimous decision of this Court  in\\nThe State of Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala (3) where at p.\\nThe  Court of Appeal has rightly pointed out that  when  the\\nvalidity  of an Act is called in question, the  first  thing\\nfor  the court to do is to examine whether the Act is a  law\\nwith   respect  to  a  topic  assigned  to  the   particular\\nLegislature  which enacted it. if it is, then the  court  is\\nnext  to consider whether, in the case of an Act  passed  by\\nthe  Legislature of a Province now a State),  its  operation\\nextends beyond the boundaries of the Province or the  State,\\nfor under the provisions conferring legislative powers on it\\nsuch Legislature can only make a law for its territories  or\\nany  part thereof and its laws cannot, in the absence  of  a\\nterritorial nexus, have any extra territorial operation.  If\\nthe  impugned law satisfies both these tests,  then  finally\\nthe court has to ascertain if there is anything in any other\\npart  of  the Constitution which places \\u02dcany fetter  on  the\\nlegislative  powers of such Legislature.  The  impugned  law\\nhas to pass all these three test.\\\"\\nTherefore,  the mere use of the word \\u02dc(6 void \\\" in  Art.  13\\ndoes not necessarily militate against the application of the\\ndoctrine of waiver in respect of the provisions contained in\\nPart   III   of  our  Constitution.   Under   the   American\\nConstitution   also,   a  law  made  in   violation   of   a\\nconstitutional guarantee is struck down, because under  Art.\\nVI of that Constitution, \\\" the Constitution and the laws  of\\nthe United States which\\n(1) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 589.

Is there any  thing  in\\nthe  preamble  and  the scheme  of  our  Constitution,  with\\nparticular  reference  to  Part III,  which  will  make  the\\ndoctrine of waiver inapplicable ? Let me first place the two\\npreambles side by side:\\n     Premple to our             Premple to the American\\n      Constitution.                Constitution,1787.\\n  \\\"We the people of India     \\\"We the people of the United\\nhaving solemny resolved to     States, in order to form a\\nconstitute India into a so-    more perfect Union,establish\\nvereign democratic republic    justice,insure domestic tra-\\nand to secure to all its ci-   nquillity,provide for the\\ntizens:justice,social,ecc-     common defence,promote the\\nnomic and political; liber-    general welfare,and secure\\nty of though,expression,       the blessing of liberty to\\nbelief,faith and worship;      ourselves and our posterity\\nequality of status and of      do ordain and establish\\nopportunity;and to promote     this Constitution for the\\namong them all fraternity      United State of America.\\\"\\nassuring the dignity of the\\nindividual and the unity of\\nthe nation;in our Constitu-\\nent Assemply this twenty-\\nsixth day of November,1949\\ndo hereby adopt,enact and\\ngive to ourselves this Co-\\nnstitution.\\\"\\nAmerican  Constitution  were : (a) to form  a  more  perfect\\nUnion;  (b)  to establish justice; (c)  to  insure  domestic\\ntranquillity;  (d)  to promote general welfare; and  (e)  to\\nsecure  the blessings of liberty.  In our Constitution,  the\\nemphasis  is  on  the Welfare  State-on   Justice,  Liberty,\\nEquality and Fraternity.  But the question before us is  the\\nlimited  question  of  the application of  the  doctrine  of\\nwaiver.  I do not find any. thing in the two preambles which\\nwill  make  the  doctrine applicable in  one  case  and  not\\napplicable in the other.\\nIt  is necessary to refer here to one important  distinction\\nbetween  the  two  Constitutions.   Speaking  broadly,   the\\nAmerican  Constitution  of  1787, except  for  defining  the\\nenumerated powers of the Federal Government and limiting the\\npowers  of  the  States, was an outline  of  government  and\\nnothing  more.   Its  provisions  were  written  in  general\\nlanguage  and  did  not  provide  minute  specifications  of\\nOrganisation   or   power.    It   contemplated   subsequent\\nlegislation  and interpretation for carrying the  provisions\\ninto  effect.  In other words, it was early recognised  that\\nthe   Constitution  was  not  self-executing.   The   Indian\\nConstitution  is  more  detailed, and in  Part  III  of  the\\nConstitution  are  provisions which not  merely  define  the\\nrights  but  also state to what extent they are  subject  to\\nrestrictions  in the interests of general welfare, etc.   In\\nother words, there is an attempt at adjustment of individual\\nrights  with social good, and in that sense the  limitations\\nor  restrictions are also defined.  But I do not think  that\\nthis distinction has any particular bearing on the  question\\nat issue before us.  The rights as also the restrictions are\\njusticiable,  and an interpretation of the rights given  and\\nof   the  restrictions  imposed,  by  courts  of   competent\\njurisdiction is contemplated.\\nIndeed,  I recognise that there is a  constitutional  policy\\nbehind   the   provisions  enacted  in  Part  III   of   the\\nConstitution.  In a, sense, there is a legislative policy in\\nall  statutory  enactments.   In  my  opinion,  the  crucial\\nquestion  is  not  whether  there  is  a  constitutional  or\\nlegislative  policy behind a particular provision,  but  the\\nquestion is-is the provision meant\\n                    597\\nprimarily  for the benefit of individuals or is it  for  the\\nbenefit  of  the general public ? That  distinction  has,  I\\nthink, been recognised in more than one decision.  Take, for\\nexample,  an ordinary statutory enactment like s. 80 of  the\\nCode  of  Civil Procedure which says that no suit  shall  be\\ninstituted  against  the  Government  or  against  a  public\\nofficer in respect of any act purporting to be done by  such\\npublic officer in his official capacity until the expiration\\nof two months next after a notice in writing has been given,\\netc.  There is undoubtedly a reason of public policy  behind\\nthis  provision,  but  it is open to  the  party  for  whose\\nbenefit the vision has been made to waive notice and  indeed\\nthe  party may be estopped by his conduct from pleading  the\\nwant  of  notice.  As the Privy Council pointed out  in  AL.\\nAR.   Villavar  Chettiar v. Government of  the  Province  of\\nMadras   (1),   there  is  no  inconsistency   between   the\\npropositions that the provisions of a section are  mandatory\\nand  must  be  enforced by the court and that  they  may  be\\nwaived by the authority for whose benefit they are provided.\\nThe question then is-is there anything in the statute  which\\nmilitates against the application of the doctrine of  waiver\\nto  such  right, subject to the safeguards  and  precautions\\nnecessary for the application of the doctrine, provided  the\\nright is for the benefit of individuals ?\\nI  am  conscious that rights which the  Constitution  itself\\ncharacterises as fundamental must be treated as such and  it\\nwill  be wrong to whittle them down.  But are  we  whittling\\ndown  fundamental  rights when we say that the  question  of\\nwaiver  of  fundamental  rights cannot be  answered  in  the\\nabstract-by a general affirmative or a general negative; the\\nquestion  must always depend on (a) the nature of the  right\\nguaranteed and (b) the foundation on the basis of which  the\\nplea  of waiver is raised.  It is to be remembered that  the\\nrights  guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution  are  not\\nconfined  to  citizens  alone.   Some  of  the  rights   are\\nguaranteed to non-citizens also.  Moreover, they are not all\\nrights   relating   to  justice,   liberty,   equality   and\\nfraternity; some of the provisions define the rights\\n(A)  (1947) L.R. 74 I.A. 223, 228.\\nwhile others indicate the restrictions or checks subject  to\\nwhich the rights are granted.  Article 33, for example, does\\nnot  give any right to any person; on the contrary it  gives\\npower  to Parliament to modify the rights conferred by  Part\\nIII in their application to persons.  Article 34 lays down a\\nconferred by Part III while in any area.  It is not,  there-\\nfore,  quite correct to say that all the provisions in  Part\\nIII  grant  fun  amental  rights,  though  the  heading   is\\n\\u2019Fundamental Rights\\u2019.\\nThere is, I think, a three-fold classification: (1) a  right\\ngranted  by  an ordinary statutory enactment;  (2)  a  right\\ngranted by. the Constitution; and (3) a right guaranteed  by\\nPart  III of the Constitution.  With regard to  an  ordinary\\nstatutory  right  there is, I think, no difficulty.   It  is\\nwell  recognised  that a statutory right which  is  for  the\\nbenefit  of  an individual can in  proper  circumstances  be\\nwaived by the party for whose benefit the provision has been\\nmade.   With  regard to a constitutional right,  it  may  be\\npointed  out  that  there  are  several  provisions  in  our\\nConstitution  which do not occur in Part III, but which  yet\\nrelate  to  certain rights; take, for  example,  the  rights\\nrelating  to the Services under the Union and the States  in\\nPart XIV.  I do not think that it can be seriously contended\\nthat  a right which is granted to a Government  servant  for\\nhis benefit cannot be waived by him, provided no question of\\njurisdiction is involved.  I may refer in this connection to\\nthe provisions in Part XIII which relate to trade,  commerce\\nand  intercourse  within  the  territory  of  India.   These\\nprovisions   also   impose  certain  restrictions   on   the\\nlegislative  powers  of  the Union and of  the  States  with\\nregard  to trade and commerce.  As these provisions are  for\\nthe benefit of the general public and not for any particular\\nindividual, they can not be waived, even though they do  not\\nfind place in Part III of the Constitution.  Therefore,  the\\ncrucial  question is not whether the rights or  restrictions\\noccur in one part or other of the Constitution.  The crucial\\nquestion  is  the nature of the right given: is it  for  the\\nbenefit of individuals or is it for the general public?\\nThat,  in  my opinion, is the true test.  I may  here  state\\nthat  the source of the right-contractual or statutory  --is\\nnot  the  determining  factor.  The doctrine  of  waiver  is\\ngrounded  on  the  principle  that  a  right,  statutory  or\\notherwise, which is for the benefit of an individual can  be\\nwaived  by  him.  I am aware that a right which is  for  the\\nbenefit  of the general public must in its actual  operation\\nrelate to particular individuals, in the same way as a right\\nfor the benefit of individuals will in its actual  operation\\narise  in connection with individual A or individual B.  The\\ntest  is  not  whether in its operation  it  relates  to  an\\nindividual.   The test is -for whose benefit the  right  has\\nbeen primarily granted for the benefit of the general public\\nor for individuals ?\\nLet me now apply this test to some of the provisions in Part\\nIII  of  the  Constitution.   These  provisions  have   been\\nclassified under different heads: (1) right to equality, (2)\\nright to freedom, (3) right against exploitation, (4)  right\\nto freedom of religion, (5) cultural and educational rights,\\n(6)  right  to  property and  (7)  right  to  constitutional\\nremedies.   There can be no doubt that some of these  rights\\nare  for  the  benefit of the  general  public.   Take,  for\\nexample,  Art. 23 which prohibits traffic in  human  beings,\\netc  ; so also Art. 24 \\u2019which says that no child  below  the\\nage  of 14 shall be employed to work in any factory or  mine\\nor engaged in any other hazardous employment.  I do not wish\\nto  multiply  examples and it is sufficient  to  state  that\\nseveral of these rights are rights which are meant primarily\\nfor  the  benefit  of  the general public  and  not  for  an\\nindividual.   But can we say the same thing in  -respect  of\\nall  the  rights ? Let us take Art. 31, which says  that  no\\nperson  shall be deprived of his property save by  authority\\nof  law and that no property shall be compulsorily  acquired\\nor  requisitioned  save  for a public purpose  and  save  by\\nauthority of law which provides for compensation, etc.  Take\\na case where a man\\u2019s property is acquired under a law  which\\ndoes  not  fix  the amount of compensation  or  specify  the\\nprinciples on which or the manner in which the  compensation\\nis to be determined and given.  The man whose\\nproperty  is taken may raise no objection to the  taking  of\\nhis property under such law.  Indeed, he may expressly agree\\nto Government taking his land for a public purpose under the\\nlaw  in  question,  though  it  does  not  comply  with  the\\nrequirements  as to compensation.  Can such a man after  two\\nor  three  years  change his mind and say that  the  law  is\\ninvalid  and  his land on which a school or a  hospital  may\\nhave  been built in the meantime should be restored to  him,\\nbecause  he could not waive his fundamental right ?   In  my\\nopinion,  if  we express the view in the  abstract  that  no\\nfundamental  right  can ever be waived, many  startling  and\\nunforeseen  results  may  follow.   Take  another   example.\\nSuppose  a man obtains a permit or a licence for  running  a\\nmotor vehicle or an excise shop.  Having enjoyed the benefit\\nof  the permit for several years, is it open to him  to  say\\nwhen action is proposed to be taken against him to terminate\\nthe licence, that the law under which the permit was granted\\nto  him was not constitutionally valid ? Having derived  all\\nthe  benefit from the permit granted to him, is it  open  to\\nhim  to  say  that the very Act under  which  a  permit  was\\ngranted  to  him  is  not valid in  law  ?  Such  and  other\\nstartling results will follow if we decide in the  abstract,\\nby a general negative, that a fundamental right can never be\\nwaived.  Take Art. 32, which is a right to a  constitutional\\nremedy,  namely,  the  right to move the  Supreme  Court  by\\nappropriate  proceedings for the enforcement of  the  rights\\nconferred  by Part III.  It is now well settled  by  several\\ndecisions  of  this court that the right under  Art.  32  is\\nitself a fundamental right.  Suppose a person exercises that\\nright and initiates appropriate proceedings for  enforcement\\nof  a  fundamental right\\u2019 Later he thinks better of  it  and\\nwithdraws his application.  Still later he changes his mind.\\nCan he then say that he could not waive his right under Art.\\nhad  no legal validity ? We may take still another  example.\\nUnder  Art.  30(1)  of  the  Constitution,  all  minorities,\\nwhether  based  on religion or language, have the  right  to\\nestablish and administer educational institutions of\\ntheir  choice.   Suppose, there is  a  minority  educational\\ninstitution  and  the minority has the right  to  administer\\nthat institution, but they want grant from Government.   The\\nminority  may  have  to  surrender  part  of  its  right  of\\nadministration  in  order to get Government  aid.   Can  the\\nminority  waive  its  right?   Such  a  question  arose  for\\nconsideration  in  the  advisory opinion which  we  gave  in\\nconnection with the Kerala Education Bill and-, so far as  I\\nhave  been able to understand, the effect of our opinion  is\\nthat  the  minority  can  surrender part  of  its  right  of\\nadministration of a school of its own choice in order to get\\naid  from Government.  If we now hold that the minority  can\\nnever  surrender its right, then the result will be that  it\\nwill never be able to ask for Government aid.\\nI  do  not  see  any  such  vital  distinction  between  the\\nprovisions  of  the American Constitution and those  of  our\\nConstitution  as  would lead me to the conclusion  that  the\\ndoctrine  of  waiver applies in  respect  of  constitutional\\nrights guaranteed by the American Constitution but will  not\\napply  in  respect of fundamental rights guaranteed  by  the\\nIndian Constitution.  Speaking generally, the prohibition in\\nPart  III  is against the State from taking  any  action  in\\nviolation of a fundamental right.  The word \\u2019State\\u2019 in  that\\nPart includes the Government and Parliament of India as also\\nthe  Government  and Legislature of each of the  States  and\\nalso all local or other authorities within the territory  of\\nIndia or under the control of the Government of India.   The\\nAmerican  Constitution also says the same thing  in  effect.\\nBy Art.  VI it states that the Constitution and the laws  of\\nthe  United States which shall be made in pursuance  thereof\\nshall be the supreme law of the land.  It is well settled in\\nAmerica  that the first ten amendments to the original  Con-\\nstitution  were substantially contemporaneous and should  be\\nconstrued  in pari materia.  In many of the  amendments  the\\nphraseology  used  is  similar to  the  phraseology  of  the\\nprovisions of Part III of our Constitution.\\nThe position under the American Constitution is\\nwell settled and a succinct statement of that position  will\\nbe  found in Rottschaefer on Constitutional Law, pp.  28-29.\\nThe learned author has summarised the position thus:\\n\\\"  There are certain constitutional provisions that  may  be\\nwaived  by  the  person  for  whose  protection  they   were\\nintended.   A  person who has waived that  protection  in  a\\ngiven instance may not thereafter. raise the issue that his,\\nconstitutional rights have been infringed in that  instance,\\nsince  whatever  injury he may incur is due to his  own  act\\nrather  than  to  the  enforcement  of  an  unconstitutional\\nmeasure against him.\\nA  person  who  would  otherwise  be  entitled  to  raise  a\\nconstitutional issue is sometimes denied that right  because\\nhe  is  estopped to do so.  The factor  usually  present  in\\nthese  cases  is  conduct  inconsistent  with  file  present\\nassertion  of that right, or conduct of such character  that\\nit  would  be  unjust  to others  to  permit  him  to  avoid\\nliability  on  constitutional  grounds.  A  person  may  not\\nquestion  the  constitutionality of the  very  provision  on\\nwhich  he bases the right claimed to be  infringed  thereby,\\nnor  of  a  provision  that  is  an  integral  part  in  its\\nestablishment  or definition.  The acceptance of  a  benefit\\nunder one provision of an Act does not ordinarily preclude a\\nperson  from  asserting\\u2019  the  invalidity  of  another   and\\nseverable  provision  thereof, but there are  exceptions  to\\nthis  rule.   The.\\u2019 promoters of a public  improvement  have\\nbeen  denied\\u2019 the right to contest the validity of the  rule\\napportioning its cost over the benefited lands, and a person\\nwho  has received the benefits of a statute may not  there-\\u2019\\nafter  assert its invalidity to defeat the claims of  those,\\nagainst  whom  it has been enforced in his  own  favour.   A\\nstate is estopped to claim that its own statute deprives it.\\nof  its  property  without due process of  law  but  it  is-\\npermitted to assert that its own statute invades rights that\\nits  constitution  confers  upon  it.   Prior   inconsistent\\nconduct  will not,however preclude a person  from  asserting\\nthe, invalidity of an act if under all the circumstances its\\nassertion involves no\\nunfairness or injustice to those against whom it is raised.\\\"\\nThe   learned  Attorney  General  placed  reliance  on   the\\nfollowing decisions: (1) Pierce v. Somerset Railway (1); (2)\\nWall v. Parrot Silver and Copper Company (2); (3) Pierce Oil\\nCorporation v. Phoenix Refining Company (3) ; (4) Shepard v.\\nBarron(4)  ; (5) United States V. Murdock(5); (6) Patton  v.\\nUnited States (6) ; and (7) Adams v. United States (7).  The\\nposition  in America is so well settled that I think  it  is\\nunnecessary to examine the aforesaid decisions in detail.  I\\nneed  only refer to the observations of Frankfurter, J.,  in\\nWilliam A. Adam\\u2019s case (supra).  The observations were  made\\nin  connection with a case where a trial was held without  a\\njury  at the request of the accused person himself in  spite\\nof the guarantee of Amendment VI. The observations were-\\n\\\"  What was contrived as protections for the accused  should\\nnot be turned into fetters.  To assert as an absolute that a\\nlayman,  no  matter how wise or experienced he  may  be,  is\\nincompetent to choose between judge and jury as the tribunal\\nfor  determining  his guilt or innocence, simply  because  a\\nlawyer  has not advised him on the choice, is  to  dogmatize\\nbeyond the bounds of learning or experience.\\\"\\nI have not been able to find any real reason on the basis of\\nwhich the decisions given above with regard to the  American\\nConstitution can be held to be inapplicable to similar cases\\narising under the Indian Constitution.\\nTwo subsidiary reasons have been given for holding that  the\\nposition under the Indian Constitution is different.  One is\\nthat  ours  is  a  nascent  democracy  and,  therefore,  the\\ndoctrine  of  waiver should not apply.  With respect,  I  am\\nunable to concur in this view.  I do not think that we shall\\nbe  advancing  the  cause  of  democracy  by  converting   a\\nfundamental  right into a fetter or using it as a means  for\\ngetting out of an\\n(1)  (1898) 171 U.S. 641.\\n(2)  (1917) 244.U.S.407.\\n(3)  (1922) 259.U.S.125.\\n(4)  (1904) 194.U.S.553.\\n(5)  (1931) 284.U.S.141.\\n(6)  (1930) 281.U.S.276.\\n(7)  (1942) 317.U.S.269.\\nagreement freely entered into by the parties.  I  appreciate\\nthat  waiver  is not to be light heartedly  applied,  and  I\\nagree that it must be applied with the fullest rigour of all\\nnecessary safeguards and cautions.  What I seriously  object\\nto  is  a statement in the abstract and \\\"in  absolute  terms\\nthat  in  no circumstances can a right given by any  of  the\\nprovisions  in  Part  III of  the  Constitution  be  waived.\\nAnother  point  taken  is that the provisions  in  Part  III\\nembody what are called  natural rights\\u2019 and such rights have\\nbeen  retained  by the people and can  never  be  interfered\\nwith.   I  am unable to acquiesce in this.   The  expression\\nnatural  rights\\u2019  is in itself somewhat  vague.   Sometimes,\\nrights  have  been divided into  natural rights\\u2019  and  civil\\nrights\\u2019,  and  natural rights\\u2019 have been stated to be  those\\nwhich are necessarily inherent or innate and which come from\\nthe very elementary laws of nature whereas civil rights  are\\nthose  which arise from the needs of civil as  distinguished\\nfrom  barbaric communities.  I am unable, however, to  agree\\nthat any such distinction is apparent from the provisions in\\nPart  III  of our Constitution: all the rights  referred  to\\ntherein appear to be created by the Constitution.  I do  not\\nthink  that Locke\\u2019s doctrine of natural rights\\u2019,  which  was\\nperhaps  the  authority  for  the  American  Declaration  of\\nIndependence,  played  any  part in  the  enactment  of  the\\nprovisions  of Part III of our Constitution.   The  doctrine\\nwhich  has long since ceased to receive general  acceptance,\\nhas  been thus explained by E. W. Paterson (see Natural  Law\\nand  Natural  Rights, Southern Methodist  University  Press,\\nDallas, 1955, p. 61):\\n\\\" The theory of natural rights, for which we are indebted to\\nthe seventeenth-century English philosopher, John Locke,  is\\nessentially different from the theories of natural law  just\\ndiscussed   in   that   it   lacked   the   two    important\\ncharacteristics   above  -mentioned:  the  concept   of   an\\nimmutable   physical  order  and  the  concept   of   divine\\nreason............ He begins with the purpose of  justifying\\nthe  existence of a government with coercive  powers.   What\\ninconveniences would arise if there were no government?  Men\\nwould live in a \\\" stage of nature\\u2019; to avoid confusion  with\\nthe\\n                    605\\npolitical  state I shall call this a  condition of  nature\\u2019.\\nIn such a condition man would be free to work, to enjoy  the\\nfruits  of his labour, and to barter with others;  he  would\\nalso  be free to enforce the law of nature  (whose  precepts\\nLocke did not define) against every other man.  Since  Locke\\nwas an optimist about human nature he thought men would  get\\nalong  pretty  well  in this  lawless  condition.   Yet  the\\ncondition  of  nature  is  for  Locke  a  fiction  like  the\\nassumption  of  a frictionless machine  in  mechanics.   The\\nchief disadvantages that men in this condition would  suffer\\nwere,  he thought, the absence of an established  law,,  the\\nabsence  of  a  known and  impartial  magistrate  to  settle\\ndisputes, the absence of a. power sufficient to execute  and\\nenforce  the  judgment of the magistrate.   Moved  by  these\\ninconveniences,  men would enter into a social compact  with\\neach  other whereby each would transfer to a  third  person,\\nthe government, such rights over his person and property  as\\nthe   government  must  have  in  order  to   remove   these\\ninconveniences.    All   other   rights,   privileges,   and\\nimmunities he reserved, as a grantor of land conveys the fee\\nsimple  to  his son and reserves a life estate  to  himself.\\nThese reserved rights were  natural\\u2019 rights because they had\\noriginated  in  the  condition of nature  and  survived  the\\nsocial compact.\\\"\\nThere  are, in my opinion, clear indications in Part III  of\\nthe  Constitution  itself  that the doctrine  of  \\u2019  natural\\nrights\\u2019  had  played  no  part in  the  formulation  of  the\\nprovisions  therein.   Take Arts. 33, 34 and 35  which  give\\nParliament power to modify the rights conferred by Part III.\\nIf they were natural rights, the Constitution could not have\\ngiven  power to Parliament to modify them.  Therefore, I  am\\nof  the view that the doctrine of \\u2019natural  rights\\u2019  affords\\nnothing but a foundation of shifting sand for building up  a\\nthesis  that  the doctrine of waiver does not apply  to  the\\nrights guaranteed in Part III of our Constitution.\\nThe true position as I conceive it is this: where a right or\\nprivilege  guaranteed  by  the  Constitution  rests  in  the\\nindividual  and  is primarily intended for his  benefit  and\\ndoes not impinge on the right of others, it\\ncan  be waived provided such waiver is not forbidden by  law\\nand does not contravene public. policy or public morals.\\nIn  the  case  before  us, I have  held  that  there  is  no\\nfoundation   on  facts  to  sustain  the  plea  of   waiver.\\nTherefore,  I would allow the appeal with costs.  The  order\\nof the Commissioner of Income-tax, Delhi, dated January  29,\\nimplementation  of the order of the Union  Government  dated\\nJuly 5, 1954, must be quashed.\\nSUBBA  RAO,  J.-I  have had the advantage  of  perusing  the\\njudgments  of  my  Lord the Chief  Justice  and  my  learned\\nbrother, S. K. Das, J. I agree with their conclusion, but  I\\nwould  prefer to express my opinion separately in regard  to\\nthe question of the applicability of the doctrine of  waiver\\nto the fundamental rights.\\nThis  case  raises a most serious  and  important  question,\\nviz.,  whether  the  doctrine  of  waiver  operates  on  the\\nfundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, a question\\nnot  confined to the immediate purpose of  this  litigation,\\nbut  to  the public in general.  The question  is  bound  to\\narise  frequently,  and  the  varying  observations  already\\nexpressed  by  the learned Judges of this Court  would  lend\\nscope   for  conflicting  decisions  involving  parties   in\\nunnecessary litigation and avoidable hardship.  The question\\nwas  directly  raised and fully argued before  us.   In  the\\ncircumstances,  I  cannot share the opinion  of  my  learned\\nbrother,  S.  K.  Das, J., that this Court  should  avoid  a\\ndecision  on this question and leave it to be decided  in  a\\nmore appropriate case.\\nThe  facts  have  been fully stated by  my  Lord  the  Chief\\nJustice in his judgment and I need not restate them.\\nThe learned Attorney General contended that in the  American\\nLaw the principle of waiver was applied to rights created by\\nthe Constitution except in cases where the protection of the\\nrights  was based upon public policy and that, by  the  same\\nanalogy,  if no public policy was involved, even  in  India,\\nthe person\\n                    607\\naffected by the infringement of the fundamental rights could\\nwaive  the constitutional protection guaranteed to him.   It\\nwas  said that in the present case the appellant waived  his\\nfundamental  right under Art. 14 of the Constitution as  the\\nright  was  only in respect of his liability to tax  and  he\\ncould  legitimately waive it.  To, appreciate this  argument\\nit would be convenient at the outset to notice the  American\\nLaw  on  the subject.  Certain rights, which  are  sometimes\\ndescribed as the Bill of Rights, have been introduced by the\\nAmendment; to the Constitution of America.  They declare the\\nrights of the people of America in respect of the freedom of\\nreligion speech, press, assemblage and from illegal seizurs.\\nThey  guarantee trial by jury in certain criminal and  civil\\nmatters.   They give protection against  self-incrimination.\\nThe Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States\\nprescribes  that  no  person shall  be  deprived  of  life.,\\nliberty  or property without due process of law;  nor  shall\\nprivate  property  be  taken for  public  use  without  just\\ncompensation.  The Fourteenth Amendment of the  Constitution\\nintroduces  the rule of due process as a protection  against\\nthe  State  action.  The said amendments are intended  as  a\\nprotection  to citizens against the action of the Union  and\\nthe  States.  Though the rights so declared are general  and\\nwide in their terms, the Supreme Court of America, by a long\\ncourse  of -judicial, interpretation, having regard  to  the\\nsocial  conditions\\u2019  in that country, has given  content  to\\nthose  rights and imposed limitations thereon in an  attempt\\nto reconcile individual rights with social good, by evolving\\ncounterbalancing   doctrines   of  police   power,   eminent\\ndomain,,.  and  such  others.   During  the  course  of  the\\nevolution.  of  the  law, attempts were made  to  apply  the\\ndoctrine of waiver to the provisions of the Constitution  of\\nAmerica.   American Courts applied the doctrine  with  great\\ncaution  and  in  applying  the  same,  laid  down  definite\\nprinciples.\\nThe  said  principles  were  culled  out  from  the  various\\ndecisions and clearly summarized in the authoritative, text-\\nbooks on the Constitution of America under different heads:\\nWILLIS ON \\u2019CONSTITUTIONAL LAW\\u2019:\\nThe  privilege  against self-incrimination\\u2019  like-any  other\\nprivilege, is one which may be waived.\\nDouble  jeopardy is a privilege and may be waived  expressly\\nor impliedly.\\nThe  immunity is one which may be waived and by consent  one\\ncan make a search and seizure reasonable.\\nThe United States Supreme Court......... held that neither a\\njurisdictional  question nor the interest of the  State  was\\ninvolved,  but only the privilege and right of the  accused,\\nand that these were subject to waiver in accordance with the\\nusual rules.\\nIn  order to delimit personal liberty by  exercising  social\\ncontrol,  the branch of the government undertaking to do  so\\nmust  have jurisdiction.  If it does not have  jurisdiction,\\nit  is taking personal liberty (life, liberty  or  property)\\nwithout  due  process  of law.  To this rule  there  are  no\\nexceptions.  It cannot be waived.\\n\\u2019COOLEY\\u2019S CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS\\u2019:\\nWhere  a  constitutional  provision  is  designed  for,  the\\nprotection solely of the property rights of the. citizen, it\\nis competent for him to waive the protection, and to consent\\nto  such  action as would be invalid if  taken  against  his\\nwill.\\nIn  criminal  cases  the  doctrine  that  a   constitutional\\nprivilege  may  be  waived must be true to  a  very  limited\\nextent  only.   A  party may consent  to  waive  rights  of.\\nproperty, but the trial and punishment for. public  offences\\nare  not  within the provinces of individual  con.  sent  or\\nagreement.\\nCORPUS JURIS SECUNDUM:\\nIt  has  been  stated  supra (p. 1050,  note  32)  that  the\\ndoctrine of waiver extends to rights and privileges\\n                    609\\nof any character, and since the word \\u2019 waiver\\u2019 covers  every\\nconceivable right, it is the general rule that a person  may\\nwaive  any  matter  which  affects  his  property,  and  any\\nalienable  right  or privilege of which he is the  owner  or\\nwhich  belongs  to him or to which he is  legally  entitled,\\nwhether  secured  by  contract,  conferred  by  statute,  or\\nguaranteed   by  constitution,  provided  such  rights   and\\nprivileges  rest  in the individual, are intended  \\u2019for  his\\nsole  benefit, do not infringe on the rights of others,  and\\nfurther provided the waiver Of the right or privilege is not\\nforbidden by law, and does not contravene public policy, and\\nthe  principle  is recognized that everyone has a  right  to\\nwaive,  and agree to waive, the advantage of a law  or  rule\\nmade solely for the benefit and protection of the individual\\nin  his  private capacity, if it can be dispensed  with  and\\nrelinquished  without  infringing on any  public  right  and\\nwithout detriment to the community at large.........\\nAs  a general rule, rights relating to procedure and  remedy\\nare  subject to waiver, but if a right is so fundamental  in\\nits  nature  as  to  be regarded by  the  state  as  vitally\\nintegrated  in  immemorially established  processes  of  the\\nadministration of justice, it cannot be waived by anyone.\\nThe  cases  cited  at  the  Bar  illustrate  the   aforesaid\\nprinciples.   The  doctrine was applied to  the  obligations\\nunder  a  contract  in Pierce v. Somerset  Railway  (1);  to\\ndeprivation of property without due process of law in Pierce\\nOil  Corporation v. Phoenix Refining Company(2) and  Shepard\\nv.  Barron (3) to trial by jury in Patton v.  United  States\\n(4)     and   Adams  v.  United  States(5);  and   to   self-\\nincrimination in United States v. Murdock (6).  It is  true,\\nas the learned counsel for the appellant contended, that  in\\nsome  of  the aforesaid decisions, observations are  in  the\\nnature  of  obiter, but they clearly indicate the  trend  of\\njudicial opinion in America.\\n(1)  (1898) 43 L.

Ed. 268.\\n(6)  (1931) 76 L. Ed 210; 284 U.S. 141.\\nThe American Law on the subject may be summarized thus:  The\\ndoctrine of waiver can be invoked when the Constitutional or\\nStatutory  guarantee of a right is not conceived  in  public\\ninterest or when it does not affect the jurisdiction of  the\\nauthority  infringing the said right.  But if the  privilege\\nconferred or the right created by the statute is solely  for\\nthe benefit of the individual, he can waive it.  But even in\\nthose  cases  the Courts invariably administered  a  caution\\nthat  having regard to the nature of the right some  precau-\\ntionary  and stringent conditions should be  applied  before\\nthe doctrine is invoked or applied.\\nThis leads me to the question whether the fundamental rights\\nenshrined  in  the  Indian  Constitution  pertain  to   that\\ncategory  of  rights  which  could be  waived.   To  put  it\\ndifferently, whether the Constitutional guarantee in  regard\\nto   the   fundamental  rights  restricts   or   ousts   the\\njurisdiction   of   the  relevant  authorities   under   the\\nConstitution  to make laws in derogation of the said  rights\\nor  whether  the  said rights are for  the  benefit  of  the\\ngeneral public.  At the outset I would like to sound a  note\\nof  warning.   While it is true that the  judgments  of  the\\nSupreme Court of the United States are of a great assistance\\nto  this  Court  in elucidating and  solving  the  difficult\\nproblems  that  arise  from  time to  time,  it  is  equally\\nnecessary  to keep in mind the fact that the  decisions  are\\ngiven  in  the context of a different social,  economic  and\\npolitical  set  up,  and  therefore  great  care  should  be\\nbestowed  in  applying those decisions to cases  arising  in\\nIndia   with  different  social,  economic   and   political\\nconditions.   While  the principles evolved by  the  Supreme\\nCourt of the United States of America may in certain circum-\\nstances  be accepted, their application to similar facts  in\\nIndia  may  not  always lead to the  same  results.   It  is\\ntherefore   necessary   to  consider  the  nature   of   the\\nfundamental rights incorporated in the Indian  Constitution,\\nthe  conditions  of  the people for whose  benefit  and  the\\npurpose  for which they were created, and the effect of  the\\nlaws made in violation of those rights.  The Constitution of\\nIndia  in  its preamble promises to secure to  all  citizens\\njustice, social, economic and\\npolitical; liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and\\nworship;  equality  of  status and of  opportunity;  and  to\\npromote  among them all fraternity assuring the  dignity  of\\nthe  individual  and the unity of the nation.   One  of  the\\nthings  the  Constitution did to achieve the  object  is  to\\nincorporate  the  fundamental rights  in  the  Constitution.\\nThey  are  divided  into  seven  categories:  (i)  right  to\\nequality-Arts.  14 to 18; (ii) right to freedom-Arts. 19  to\\nright  to freedom of religion Arts. 25 to 28 ; (v)  cultural\\nand  educational  rightsArts.  29  and  30;  (vi)  right  to\\nproperty-Arts.  31,  31  A  and  31B;  and  (vii)  right  to\\nConstitutional  remediesArts. 32 to 35.   Patanjali  Sastri,\\nJ., as he then was, pointed out, in Gopalan v. The, State of\\nMadras(1), that fundamental rights contained in Part III  of\\nthe  Constitution are really rights that are still  reserved\\nto  the people after the delegation of rights by the  people\\nto the institutions of Government both at the Centre and  in\\nthe States created by the Constitution.  Article 13 reads :-\\n(1) All laws in force in the territory of India  immediately\\nbefore  the commencement of this Constitution, in so far  as\\nthey  are inconsistent with the pro. visions of  this  Part,\\nshall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void.\\n(2)  The  State shall not make any law which takes away  or,\\nabridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law  made\\nin contravention of this clause, shall, to the extent of the\\ncontravention, be void.\\\"\\nThis  Article,  in  clear and unambiguous  terms,  not  only\\ndeclares  that all laws in fore before the  commencement  of\\nthe   Constitution  and  made  thereafter  taking  away   or\\nabridging the said rights would be void to the extent of the\\ncontravention  but also prohibits the State from making  any\\nlaw  taking away or abridging the said rights.  Part III  is\\ntherefore  enacted  for the benefit of all the  citizens  of\\nIndia,  in an attempt to preserve to them their  fundamental\\nrights  against infringement by the institutions created  by\\nthe Constitution; for, without that safeguard, the objects\\n(1) [1950] S. C. R. 88.\\nadumbrated in the Constitution could not be-achieve,-].  For\\nthe  same purpose, the said chapter imposes a limitation  on\\nthe  power of the State to make laws in violation  of  those\\nrights.  The entire part, in my view, has been introduced in\\npublic  interest, and it is not proper that the  fundamental\\nrights   created  under  the  various  Articles  should   be\\ndissected to ascertain whether any or which part of them  is\\nconceived  in  public  interest and which part  of  them  is\\nconceived  for  individual benefit.  Part III  reflects  the\\nattempt  of the Constitution makers to reconcile  individual\\nfreedom  with State Control.  While in America this  process\\nof reconciliation was allowed to be evolved by the course of\\njudicial  decisions,  in India, the fundamental  rights  and\\ntheir  limitations  are  crystallized and  embodied  in  the\\nConstitution  itself; while in America a freehand was  given\\nto the judiciary not only to evolve the content of the right\\nbut  also its limitations, in the Indian Constitution  there\\nis  not  much scope for such a process.   The  Court  cannot\\ntherefore import any further limitations on the  fundamental\\nrights  other  than  those  contained in  Part  III  by  any\\ndoctrine,  such  as  \\\"  waiver \\\"  or  otherwise.   I  would,\\ntherefore, hold that the fundamental rights incorporated  in\\nPart III of the Constitution cannot be waived.\\nIt  is said. that such an inflexible rule would, in  certain\\ncases,  defeat  the very object for  which  the  fundamental\\nrights  are  created.   I  have  carefully  scrutinized  the\\nArticles in Part III of the Constitution of India, and  they\\ndo  not,  in my view, disclose any such  anomaly  or  create\\nunnecessary  hardship to\\u2019 the people for whose  benefit  the\\nrights  are  created.   Article,  14  embodies  the   famous\\nprinciple of equality before the law and equal protection of\\nthe  laws,  and  Arts. 15 to 18 and  Art.  29(2)  relate  to\\nparticular   applications  of  the  rule.    The   principle\\nunderlying   these  Articles  is  the  mainspring   of   our\\ndemocratic  form  of  government and it  guarantees  to  its\\ncitizens equal protection in respect of both substantive and\\nprocedural laws.  If the doctrine of waiver is engrafted  to\\nthe said fundamental principles, it will mean that a citizen\\ncan  agree  to  be discriminated.\\u2019  When  one  realizes  the\\nunequal\\n                    613\\npositions  occupied  by the State and the  private  citizen,\\nparticularly  in  India where illiteracy is rampant,  it  is\\neasy  to visualize that in a conflict between the State  and\\n-a  citizen,  the latter may, by fear of force  or  hope  of\\npreferment,  give up his right.  It is said that in  such  a\\ncase coercion or influence can be established in a Court  of\\nlaw,  but in practice it will be well nigh impossible to  do\\nso.  The same reasoning will apply to Arts. 15 and 16.  Art.\\nwaiver  in  its  impact on  the  fundamental  rights.   That\\nArticle in express terms forbids untouchability;  obviously,\\na   person  cannot  ask  the  State  to  treat  him  as   an\\nuntouchable.  Article 19 reads:-\\n\\\"(1) All citizens shall have the right-\\n(a)  to freedom of speech and expression;\\n(b)  to assemble peaceably and without arms;\\n(c)  to form associations or unions;\\n(d)  to move freely throughout the territory of\\nIndia ;\\n(e)to  reside  and settle in any part of  the  territory  of\\nIndia;\\n(f)  to acquire, hold and dispose of property ; and\\n(g)  to  practice  any  profession,  or  to  carry  on   any\\noccupation, trade or business.\\\"\\nThe right to freedom is the essential attribute of a citizen\\nunder democratic form of government.  The freedoms mentioned\\nin Art. 19 are subject to certain restrictions mentioned  in\\ncls.  (2)  to (6) of that Article.  So far as  the  freedoms\\nnarrated  in sub-cls. (a) to (g) of Cl. (1) of Art.  19  are\\nconcerned,  I  cannot  visualise  any  contingency  where  a\\ncitizen  would  be -in a worse position than he  was  if  he\\ncould  not  exercise  the right of  waiver.   In  regard  to\\nfreedom  to  acquire,  hold  and  dispose  of  property,   a\\nplausible  argument may be advanced, namely, that a  citizen\\nshould have a right to waive his right to acquire, hold  and\\ndispose  of property ; for, otherwise he might be  compelled\\nto  acquire  and hold his property, even if he  intended  to\\ngive it up  There is an underlying fallacy in this argument.\\nThe Article does not compel a citizen to acquire, hold and\\ndispose of property just as it does not compel a per. son to\\ndo  any  of the acts covered by the other freedoms.   If  he\\ndoes  not  want to reside in any part of  the  territory  of\\nIndia or to make a speech or to practise any profession,  he\\nis  at liberty not to do any of ,,these things.  So  too,  a\\nperson  may not acquire the property at all or practise  any\\nprofession  but if he seeks to acquire property or  practise\\nany  profession,  he cannot be told that he has  waived  his\\nright  at an earlier stage to acquire property  or  practise\\nthe  profession.  A freedom to do a particular act  involves\\nthe  freedom  not  to do that act.  There  is  an  essential\\ndistinction  between  the non-exercise of a  right  and  the\\nexercise  of a right subject to the doctrine of waiver.   So\\nunderstood, even in the case of the right covered by sub-cl.\\n(f) of cl. (1), there cannot be any occasion when a  citizen\\nwould  be worse off than when he had no  fundamental  rights\\nunder  the  Article.  The preservation of the  rights  under\\nArt.  19 without any further engrafting of  any  limitations\\nthan  those  already  imposed  under  the  Constitution,  is\\ncertainly  in the interest of the public ; for,  the  rights\\nare  essential for the development of human  personality  in\\nits diverse aspects.  Some comment is made in regard to  the\\nright covered by el. (3) of Art. 20, and it is asked that if\\na  person has no liberty to waive the protection under  that\\nclause, he could not give evidence even if he wanted to give\\nit  in his own interest.  This argument ignores the  content\\nof  the  right under cl. (3) of Art.  20.   The  fundamental\\nright of a person is only that he should not be compelled to\\nbe a witness against himself.  It would not prevent him from\\ngiving evidence voluntarily.  Under Art. 21, no person shall\\nbe deprived of his life or personal liberty except according\\nto procedure established by law and Art. 22 gives protection\\nagainst  arrest  and detention in certain cases.  I  do  not\\nthink  that  any situation can be conceived  when  a  person\\ncould  waive  this right to his  advantage.   Article  23(1)\\nprohibits traffic in human beings and forced labour.  It  is\\nnot  suggested that a person can waive  this  Constitutional\\nprotection.   So  too,  the  right  under  Art.  24,   which\\nprohibits employment\\nof children in factories, cannot be waived.  That apart,  so\\nfar as this Article is concerned, no question of waiver  can\\narise as a child cannot obviously waive his right under this\\nArticle.   Article 25 gives guarantee for religious  liberty\\nsubject  to  certain  restrictions  contained  therein.   It\\ndeclares  that all persons are  equally entitled  to freedom\\nof conscience and the right freely to profess, practise  and\\npropagate  religion.  This right is certainly  conceived  in\\nthe  public interest and cannot be waived.  So too,  freedom\\nto manage religious affairs, freedom as to payment Of  taxes\\nfor  promotion of any particular religion and freedom as  to\\nattendance at religious instruction or religious worship  in\\ncertain  educational  institutions  are  all  conceived   to\\nenforce the religious neutrality of the State and it  cannot\\nbe  suggested  that they are not in  public  interest.   The\\ncultural and educational rights of the minorities and  their\\nright  to establish and administer educational  institutions\\nof  their choice are given for the protection of the  rights\\nof the minorities and it cannot be said that they are not in\\npublic interest.  Article 31, which prohibits the State from\\ndepriving a person of his property save by authority of  law\\nor  to acquire any property without paying compensation,  is\\nintended to protect the properties of persons from arbitrary\\nactions  of  the State.  This Article is  conceived  in  the\\ninterest  of the public and a person cannot say that he  can\\nbe deprived of his property without authority of law or that\\nhis land can be acquired without compensation.\\nIt  is  suggested  that  if  a  person,  after  waiving  his\\nfundamental  right  to property and allowing  the  State  to\\nincur  heavy expenditure in improving the same, turns  round\\nand claims to recover the said property, the State would  be\\nput to irreparable injury.  Firstly, no such occasion should\\narise,  as the State is not expected to take  its  citizens\\u2019\\nproperty or deprive them of their property otherwise than by\\nauthority  of  law.  Secondly, if the owner  of  a  property\\nintends to give it to the State, the State can always insist\\nupon  conveying to it the said property in the manner  known\\nto law.  Thirdly, other remedies may be open to the\\nrecover   compensation  or  damages  for  the   improvements\\nbonafide  made  or the loss incurred, having regard  to  the\\ncircumstances  of a particular case.  These  considerations,\\nin my view, are of no relevance in considering the  question\\nof waiver in the context of fundamental rights.  By  express\\nprovisions of the Constitution, the State is prohibited from\\nmaking  any  law  which takes away or  abridges  the  rights\\nconferred  by  Part III of the Constitution.  The  State  is\\nnot,  therefore, expected to enforce any right  contrary  to\\nthe Constitutional prohibition on the ground that the  party\\nwaived his fundamental right.  If this prohibition is  borne\\nin  mind,  no occasion can arise when the\\u2019  State  would  be\\nprejudiced.   The prejudice, if any, to the State  would  be\\ncaused not by the non-application of the doctrine of  waiver\\nbut  by  its  own  action  contrary  to  the  Constitutional\\nprohibition imposed on it.\\nIt  is  then said that if the doctrine of waiver  is  to  be\\nexcluded, a person can apply to the Supreme Court under Art.\\nwithdraw  the petition, get the order of the  Supreme  Court\\ndismissing it and then apply over again for issue of a  writ\\nin respect of the same right.  The apprehension so expressed\\nis  more  imaginary  than real; for, it  has  no  foundation\\neither in fact or in law.  When an application is dismissed,\\nfor  whatever  reason  it may be-whether  on  merits  or  on\\nadmission-, the order of the Court becomes final and it  can\\nbe reopened only in the manner prescribed by law.  There  is\\nno  scope for the application of the doctrine of  waiver  in\\nsuch a cage.\\nArticles  33  and  34 contain  some  of  the  Constitutional\\nlimitations  on the application and the enforcement  of  the\\nfundamental  rights.  The former.  Article confers power  on\\nParliament to modify the rights conferred by Part III of the\\nConstitution  in their application to facts and  the  latter\\nenables  it to impose restrictions on the  rights  conferred\\nby\\u2019 that Part, while martial law is in force in any area.\\nThese  two  Articles, therefore, do not  create  fundamental\\nrights, but impose limitations thereon and I\\n                    617\\ncannot  appreciate the argument that their presence in  Part\\nIII  either  derogates from the content of  the  fundamental\\nrights  declared therein or sustains the doctrine of  waiver\\nin  its application to the said rights.  Article 35  confers\\non the Parliament, the power to legislate for giving  effect\\nto  the  provisions  of Part III  to  the  exclusion  of the\\nLegislatures  of  the, States.  This Article also  does  not\\ncreate  a  fundamental right, but provides a  machinery  for\\nenforcing that right.\\nA  startling  result, it is suggested, would flow  from  the\\nrejection  of the doctrine of waiver and the  suggestion  is\\nsought to be illustrated by the following example : A person\\ntakes a permit for several years from the State for  running\\na  motor  vehicle  or an excise shop.   Having  enjoyed  the\\nbenefit for several years and when action is proposed to  be\\ntaken against him to terminate the licence, he contends that\\nthe  law under which the permit was granted to him  offended\\nhis  fundamental rights and therefore  constitutionally  not\\nvalid.   It is asked whether it would be open to him to  say\\nthat the very Act under which the permit was granted to  him\\nwas  not valid in law.  To my mind, this  illustration  does\\nnot  give  rise to any anomaly.  Either a person can  run  a\\nmotor  vehicle  or an excise shop with  licence  or  without\\nlicence.  On the basis the law is valid, a licence is  taken\\nand the motor vehicle is run under that licence and if  that\\nlaw  offends  his fundamental right and therefore  void,  he\\ncontinues to ran the business without licence, as no licence\\nis  required under a valid law.  The aforesaid  illustration\\ndoes not, there. fore, give rise to any anomaly and even  if\\nit does, it does not affect the legal position.\\nI  have  considered the various provisions relating  to  the\\nfundamental  rights with a view to discover if there is  any\\njustification  for the comment that without the aid  of  the\\ndoctrine  of  waiver a citizen,  in  certain  circumstances,\\nwould  be  in a worse position than that he would be  if  he\\nexercised his right.  I have shown that there is none.   Nor\\nis  there any basis for the suggestion that the State  would\\nirreparably  suffer  under certain contingencies;  for,  any\\nresulting hardship would be its\\nown  making and could be avoided if it acted  in  accordance\\nwith law.\\nA  large  majority  of our  people  are  economically  poor,\\neducationally backward and politically not yet conscious  of\\ntheir  rights.   Individually  or  even  collectively,  they\\ncannot  be  pitted  against  the  State  organizations   and\\ninstitutions,  nor  can they meet them on equal  terms.   In\\nsuch circumstances, it is the duty of this Court to  protect\\ntheir  rights  against themselves.  I  have,  therefore,  no\\nhesitation in holding that the fundamental rights created by\\nthe Constitution are transcendental in nature, conceived and\\nenacted  in  national  and public  interest,  and  therefore\\ncannot be waived.\\nThat apart, I would go further and hold that as section 5(1)\\nof the Act XXX of 1947 was declared to be void by this Court\\nin M. Ct.  Muthiah v. The Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras\\n(1),  the  appellant  can. not, by the  application  of  the\\ndoctrine of waiver, validate the enquiry made under the said\\nAct.  It is suggested that there is a distinction between  a\\ncase   where  the  enactment  is  beyond   the   legislative\\ncompetence  Of  the Legislature which made it and  the  case\\nwhere the law is unconstitutional on the ground of existence\\nof  a  constitutional limitation, that while in  the  former\\ncase the law is null and void, in the latter case the law is\\nunenforceable  and  may  be revived by the  removal  of  the\\nlimitation  by  an amendment of the Constitution.   On  this\\ndistinction an argument is sought to be built to the  effect\\nthat  as in the present case s. 5(1) of the Act XXX of  1947\\nwas  declared to be invalid only on the ground that  it  was\\nhit  by Art. 14 of the Constitution, the law must be  deemed\\nto  be on the statute book and therefore the  appellant  was\\nwithin  his right to waive his constitutional guarantee.   I\\nam unable to appreciate this, argument.\\nThe  scope of Art. 13(1) of the Constitution was  considered\\nby  this  Court in Keshavan Madhava Menon v.  The  state  of\\nBombay  (2).  This Court by a majority held that Art.  13(1)\\nof the Constitution does not make\\n(1) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247.\\n(2) [1951] S.C.R. 228.\\nexisting  laws which are inconsistent with  the  fundamental\\nrights,   void  ab  initio,  but  only  renders  such   laws\\nunenforceable  and void with respect to the exercise of  the\\nfundamental rights on and after the date of commencement  of\\nthe  Constitution.  Mahajan, C. J., who was a party to  that\\ndecision,  explained  the word ,void\\u2019 in Art. 13(1)  of  the\\nConstitution in Behram Khurshed Pesikaka v. State of  Bombay\\n(1).  He observed at page 652 thus:-\\n\\\" It is axiomatic that when the law-making power of a  State\\nis  restricted  by  written fundamental law,  then  any  law\\nenacted  and opposed to the fundamental law is in excess  of\\nthe legislative authority and is thus a nullity.  Both these\\ndeclarations  of unconstitutionality go to the root  of  the\\npower itself and there is no real distinction between  them.\\nThey represent but two aspects of want of legislative power.\\nThe   legislative   power  of  Parliament  and   the   State\\nLegislatures  as  conferred  by Arts. 245  and  246  of  the\\nConstitution  stands  curtailed by  the  fundamental  rights\\nChapter of the Constitution.\\\"\\nThis decision in clear and unambiguous terms lays down  that\\nthere  cannot  be  any  distinction  on  principle   between\\nConstitutional  incompetency and Constitutional  limitation.\\nIn either case, the Act is void, though in the latter  case,\\nthe pre-constitutional rights and liabilities arising  under\\nthe  statute  are saved.  This Court again  dealt  with  the\\nmeaning  of  the word  void\\u2019 in Bhikaji  Narain  Dhakras  v.\\nState of Madhya Pradesh (2).  There the question was whether\\nan Act \\u2019Which was declared void on the ground of  inconsist-\\nency with the Constitution, can be revived by any subsequent\\namendment  to the Constitution removing  the  inconsistency.\\nThis  Court answered the question in the affirmative.   Das,\\nacting C.; J., observed at page 598 thus:-\\n\\\"  As  explained in Keshavan Madhava Menon\\u2019s case,  the  law\\nbecame void not in toto or for all purposes or for all times\\nor  for  all  persons  but  only  to  the  extent  of   such\\ninconsistency  that  is  to,say, to the  extent,  it  became\\ninconsistent with the provisions of Part\\n(1) [1955] 1 S. C. R. 613.\\n(2) [1955] 2 S. C. R. 589.\\nIII which conferred the fundamental rights on the  citizens.\\nIt did not become void independently of the existence of the\\nrights guaranteed by Part III...... In Short, Article  13(1)\\nhad  the effect of nullifying or rendering the existing  law\\nwhich  had become inconsistent with Art. 19(1)(g) read  with\\nclause (6) as it then stood ineffectual, nugatory and devoid\\nof any legal force or binding effect only with the  exercise\\nof  the  fundamental  right on and after  the  date  of  the\\ncommencement of the Constitution..................... It  is\\nonly as against the citizens that they remained in a dormant\\nor moribund condition.  In our judgment, after the amendment\\nof  clause  (6)  of  Art. 19 on the  18th  June,  1951,  the\\nimpugned  Act  ceased  to  be  unconstitutional  and  became\\nrevivified  and  enforceable  against citizens  as  well  as\\nagainst non-citizens.\\\"\\nThis  judgment  does not say anything  different  from  that\\nexpressed  in Keshavan Madhava Menon\\u2019s case (1) nor does  it\\ndissent from the view expressed by Mahajan, C. J., in Behram\\nKhurshed\\u2019s  case  (2).   The  problem  that  confronted  the\\nlearned  Judges was a different one and they resolved it  by\\napplying  the  doctrine of \\\"eclipse\\u2019.  The  legal  position,\\nvis-a-vis, the law declared to be void either on the  ground\\nof  legislative incompetence or for the reason of  constitu-\\ntional  limitation,  as  stated in  the  earlier  decisions,\\n-remains  unshaken  by  this  decision.   So  long  as   the\\ninconsistency  remains the law continues to be void, at  any\\nrate  vis-a-vis the fundamental rights of a person.  We  are\\nnot concerned in this case with the doctrine of revival; for\\nthe inconsistency of s. 5(1) of the Act with the fundamental\\nright under Art. 14 of the Constitution has not been removed\\nby any amendment of the Constitution.  So long as it is  not\\ndone,  the  said  section  is void  and  cannot  affect  the\\nfundamental  rights of the citizens.  In M. Ct.  Muthiah  v.\\nThe Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras (3), it was  declared\\nthat s. 5(1) of Act XXX of 1947 was unconstitutional on  the\\nground  that  it  infringed the fundamental  rights  of  the\\ncitizens under Art. 14 of the Constitution.\\n(1) [1951] S.C.R. 228.            (2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 613.\\n(3)  [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247.\\nUnder Art. 141 of the Constitution, the law declared by  the\\nSupreme  Court  is binding on all the Courts in  India.   It\\nfollows that the Income-tax Commissioner had no jurisdiction\\nto continue the proceedings against the appellant under  Act\\nXXX  of 1947.  If the Commissioner had no jurisdiction,  the\\nappellant could not by waiving his right confer jurisdiction\\non him.\\nThe  scope of the doctrine of waiver was considered by  this\\nCourt  in  Behram Khurshed\\u2019s case(1).  There  a  person  was\\nprosecuted  for  an  offence under s. 66(b)  of  the  Bombay\\nProhibition Act and he was sentenced to one month\\u2019s rigorous\\nimprisonment.  One of the questions raised there was whether\\ns. 13(b) of the Bombay Prohibition Act, having been declared\\nto be void under Art. 13(1) of the Constitution in so far as\\nit  affected the consumption or use of liquid  medicinal  or\\ntoilet  preparation containing alcohol, the prosecution  was\\nmaintainable  for infringement of that section.   The  Court\\nheld  that  in India once the law has been  struck  down  as\\nunconstitutional  by  the Supreme Court, no  notice  can  be\\ntaken  of it by any Court, because, after it is declared  as\\nunconstitutional, it is no longer law and is null and  void.\\nEven  so, it was contended that the accused had  waived  his\\nfundamental  right  and therefore he could not  sustain  his\\ndefence.   Mahajan,  C. J., delivering the judgment  of  the\\nmajority,  repelled  this  contention  with  the   following\\nobservations at page 653:-\\n\\\"  The  learned Attorney General when questioned  about  the\\ndoctrine  did  not seem to be very  enthusiastic  about  it.\\nWithout  finally expressing an opinion on this  question  we\\nare  not for the moment convinced that this theory  has  any\\nrelevancy in construing the fundamental rights conferred  by\\nPart  III  of our Constitution.  We think  that  the  rights\\ndescribed as fundamental rights are a necessary  consequence\\nof the declaration in the preamble that the people of  India\\nhave solemnly resolved to constitute India into a  sovereign\\ndemocratic  republic  and  to secure  to  all  its  citizens\\njustice,  social,  economic  and  political  ;  liberty  ,of\\nthought, expression, belief, faith and worship;\\n(1)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 613.\\nequality  of status and of opportunity.   These  fundamental\\nrights have not been put in the Constitution merely for  the\\nindividual   benefit  though  ultimately  they   come   into\\noperation in considering individual rights.  They have  been\\nput  there as a matter of public policy and the doctrine  of\\nwaiver  can have no application to provisions of  law  which\\nhave  been  enacted as a matter  of  Constitutional  policy.\\nReference  to  some of the articles,  inter  alia,  Articles\\ncannot  get  discrimination by telling the  State  \\u2019You  can\\ndiscriminate\\u2019,  or get convicted by waiving  the  protection\\ngiven  under Articles 20 and 21.\\\"\\nOn  the  question of waiver, Venkatarama Aiyar, J.,  in  his\\njudgment  before review, considered the  American  decisions\\nand   was  inclined  to  take  the  view  that   under   our\\nConstitution when a law contravenes the provisions  intended\\nfor  the benefit of the individual, it can be  waived.   But\\nthe  learned  Judge made it clear in his judgment  that  the\\nquestion  of  waiver  had no bearing to any  issue  of  fact\\narising for determination in that case but only for  showing\\nthe nature of the right declared under Art. 19(1)(f) and the\\neffect in law of a statute contravening it.  Das, J., as  he\\nthen was, in his dissenting judgment, did not state his view\\non this question but expressly reserved it in the  following\\nwords:-\\n\\\" In coming to the conclusion that I have, I have in a large\\nmeasure  found  myself  in  agreement  with  the  views   of\\nVenkatarama  Aiyar,  J.,  on  that part  of  the  case.   I,\\nhowever, desire to guard myself against being understood  to\\nagree  with the rest of the observations to be found in  his\\njudgment,   particularly   those  relating  to   waiver   of\\n\\u2019unconstitutionality,  the fundamental rights being  a  mere\\ncheck  on  the  legislative  power  or  the  effect  of  the\\ndeclaration  under Art. 13(1) being  relatively  void\\u2019.   On\\nthose topics prefer to express no opinion on this occasion.\\\"\\nI respectfully agree with the observations of Mahajan, C. J.\\nFor the aforesaid reasons,  hold that the doctrine of waiver\\nhas  no application in the case of fundamental rights  under\\nour Constitution.\\n                    623\\n                   ORDER\\nThe  appeal  is  allowed.

In\\nconnection  with  certain  proceedings  pending  before  the\\nIncome  Tax Investigation Commission it was found  necessary\\nto  search two premises 17, Kalakar Street and 36,  Armenian\\nStreet  to  inspect, take copies and  secure  possession  of\\ncertain books, papers and documents believed to be in  them.\\nA  warrant was issued by the Commission for this purpose  in\\nfavour of four persons, namely, H. C. Bhari, A. D. De, A. K.\\nBose and P. Mukherjee, to carry out the search.\\nThe   authorised  officials  went  to  the  Kalakar   Street\\npremises,  third  floor  on the morning  of  December  1950.\\nMatajog  Dobey, (Appellant in Criminal Appeal No.  67),  the\\ndarwan  of Kasbiram Agarwala, says that when he  found  them\\nforcibly  breaking  open the entrance door of  the  flat  he\\nchallenged them and requested them to desist.  They paid  no\\nheed to him, broke open the door, went inside and interfered\\nwith some boxes and drawers of tables.  They tied him with a\\nrope and assaulted him causing injuries.  On these facts, he\\nfiled a complaint on 27-12-1950 against H.C. Bhari and three\\nothers (names unknown) under sections 323, 341, 342 and 109,\\nIndian Penal Code,\\nArmenian  Street  premises  on the  evening  of  26-12-1950.\\nNandram  Agarwala (father of Kashiram Agarwala) came to  the\\nplace  and found that they had forcibly opened the  lock  of\\nthe  door of the room in which there were several books  and\\npapers, which they were collecting and packing into  bundles\\nfor  removal.  He protested, pointed out that their  actions\\nwere  illegal and oppressive, and he wanted a proper  search\\nlist  to be prepared and proper receipts to be given to  him\\nfor the books and documents sought to be seized and removed.\\nThereupon, two policemen held him down and he was  assaulted\\nmercilessly,  kicked,  dragged downstairs, put in  a  police\\nvan,  and taken to the Burra Bazar thana, where he  was  as-\\nsaulted  again  before being sent to the hospital.   He  was\\nbrought  back and kept in the lock up till midnight when  he\\nwas released on bail.  Setting out these facts, he lodged  a\\ncomplaint against the four officials, other subordinates and\\npolice  officers whose names he did not then know but  could\\nsupply  later.  The offences mentioned in the complaint  are\\nsections  323, 342 and 504, Indian Penal Code.   Later,  the\\nnames of two police officers were given-Bibhuti  Chakravarti\\nand Nageswar Tiwari.\\nThe  two complaints were sent over for judicial  inquiry  to\\ntwo  different  magistrates.  On 21-2-1951,  the  magistrate\\nheld  on  Agarwala\\u2019s complaint that a prima facie  case  had\\nbeen  made  out  under section 323  against  all  the  four-\\naccused and under section 342 against the two policemen.  On\\nthis report, summonses were directed to issue under  section\\nwitnesses  were  examined  in  chief  and  the  case   stood\\nadjourned to 22-5-1951.  It was on this latter date that the\\nwant of sanction under section 197, Criminal Procedure Code.\\nThe objection was upheld and all the accused disc barged  on\\nrevision,  but  the order of the Presidency  Magistrate  was\\naffirmed.\\nIn Matajog Dobey\\u2019s complaint, after the termina-\\ntion  of the inquiry, process was issued only against  Bhari\\nunder  sections 323 and 342 , Indian Penal Code  for  22-12-\\npetition  as in the other case raising the  same  objection.\\nThe magistrate on whose file the case was pending  overruled\\nthe  objection  and directed that the case  should  proceed.\\nAccused Bhari took the matter on revision to the High  Court\\nand succeeded.\\nIn  Nandram Agarwala\\u2019s case (Criminal Revision Petition  No.\\nthat  the  test formulated by the Privy  Council  in  Gill\\u2019s\\ncase(1) applied and that on a fair reading of the complaint,\\nbereft  of exaggerations and falsehoods, the officers  could\\nreasonably claim that what they did was done by them in  the\\nexercise  of their official duty.  In Matajog  Dobey\\u2019s  case\\n(Criminal  Revision Petition No. 312 of 1952),  the  learned\\nJudges (Lahiri and Guha, JJ.) came to the same conclusion in\\nthese  words: \\\"From the nature of the allegations  therefore\\nagainst  the petitioner, it is abundantly clear  that  there\\nwas something in the acts alleged against him which attached\\nthem  to the official character of the petitioner, that  is,\\nwhich attached them to his official character in holding the\\nsearch\\\".\\nMr.  Isaacs, learned counsel for the appellants in  the  two\\nappeals,  challenged the soundness of these conclusions  and\\nadvanced  three  categorical contentions  on  their  behalf.\\nFirstly, an act of criminal assault or wrongful  confinement\\ncan  never  be  regarded  as an act  done  while  acting  or\\npurporting  to  act  in  the  discharge  of  official  duty;\\nsecondly,  that in a case where the duty is clearly  defined\\nby  statute and warrant of authority, such acts could  never\\ncome  within the scope of employment; and thirdly,  that  in\\nany  case  it  was  the  duty of  the  court  to  allow  the\\nprosecution to proceed and not stifle it in limine.  He also\\nurged  that  as the entry on the 23rd December  was  into  a\\nwrong  place,  P-17,  Kalakar Street, and  not  17,  Kalakar\\nStreet  which  was the authorised premises, the  search  was\\nillegal from the commencement.  He raised the\\n(1)  [1948] L.R. 75 I.A. 41.\\nconstitutional  point that section 5(1) of the  Taxation  on\\nIncome  (Investigation  Commission)  Act XXX  of  1947)  and\\nsection  197, Criminal Procedure Code were ultra  vires,  as\\nthey  were  discriminatory  in their  nature,  and  offended\\narticle 14 of the Constitution.\\nIn  the  course of his arguments, he referred to  section  6\\nsub-sections   (7)  and  (9)  of  the  Taxation  on   Income\\n(Investigation Commission) Act (XXX of 1947) and rule 10 and\\nthe  search  warrant that was issued under them.   His  main\\nargument was that there was no power conferred by statute or\\nunder  common law on the authorised officials to assault  or\\nuse  force in the execution of their duty and any such  acts\\nmust therefore be deemed to be entirely outside the scope of\\ntheir employment.  He drew our attention to the sections  of\\nthe Criminal Procedure Code relating to searches and  quoted\\ntwo old English cases to reinforce this position.\\nThe search warrant is in these terms:\\n\\\"Warrant  of Authorisation under sections 6(7) and 6(9)  and\\nRule 8.\\nTaxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947.\\nWhereas information has been laid before the Commission  and\\non the consideration thereof the Commission has been led  to\\nbelieve that certain books, documents and papers, which  are\\nor may be relevant to proceedings under the above Act in the\\ncases  compendiously known as the S. Jhabbarmull  group  (R.\\nC. No. 313) and connected cases have been kept and are to be\\nfound  in (i) the third floor, 17, Kalakar Street,  Calcutta\\n(ii)  47  Khengraputty  Street, Calcutta-7,  and  (iii)  the\\nsecond  \\u2019floor  and adjoining rooms,  36,  Armenian  Street,\\nCalcutta,  compound, offices and out-houses or other  places\\nin that locality.\\nThis is to authorise and require you,\\nSri H. C. Bhari,\\nAuthorised Official,\\nIncome-tax Investigation Commission,\\n(a)  to  enter  and search with such  assistance  of  police\\nofficers as may be required, the said premises or any  other\\nplace or places where you may have\\nreason  to believe that such books, documents or papers  may\\nbe found;\\n(b)to  place identification marks on such  books,  documents\\nand papers as may be found and as you may consider  relevant\\nto  the  proceedings aforesaid and to make  a  list  thereof\\ntogether with particulars of the identification marks;\\n(c)  to make copies or extracts from such  books,  documents\\nand papers;\\n(d)  to  seize  such books, documents and  papers  and  take\\npossession thereof; and\\n(e)to  exercise all other powers and duties under  the  said\\nsections and the Rules relating thereto\\\".\\nStraightaway,  it may be conceded that the warrant  set  out\\nabove specifies precisely the scope of the duties  entrusted\\nto   the  authorised  officials.   Whether  they  took   any\\npolicemen with them even at the commencement or whether they\\nwere only sent for when resistance was offered is not clear.\\nThis,  however,  does not matter as the  warrant  authorises\\npolice assistance at the search.\\nThe  version of the complainants as to what happened at  the\\nsearch  is set out in the two complaints.  The story of  the\\naccused is found in the petitions filed by Bhari urging  the\\nobjection  under  section  197,  Criminal  Procedure   Code.\\nDetails about the occurrences were also elicited at the  two\\njudicial  enquiries.   There are  two  medical  certificates\\nspecifying  the  injuries  found  on  Nandram  Agarwala  and\\nMatajog Dobey.\\nThe  minor  contentions may be disposed of  at  the  outset.\\nEven  if  there was anything sound and  substantial  in  the\\nconstitutional point about the vires of section 5(1) of  the\\nAct,  we declined to go into it as it was not raised  before\\nthe High Court or in the grounds of the petition for special\\nleave  to appeal.  Article 14 does not render  section  197,\\nCriminal Procedure Code ultra vires as the discrimination is\\nbased upon a rational classification.  Public servants  have\\nto be protected from harassment in the discharge of official\\nduties while ordinary citizens not so engaged do not require\\nthis safeguard.  It was argued that\\nsection  197, Criminal Procedure Code vested  an  absolutely\\narbitrary  power  in  the government to  grant  or  withhold\\nsanction   at  their  sweet  will  and  pleasure,  and   the\\nlegislature  did not lay down or even indicate  any  guiding\\nprinciples to control the exercise of the discretion.  There\\nis no question of any discrimination between one person  and\\nanother in the matter of taking proceedings against a public\\nservant  for  an act done or purporting to be  done  by  the\\npublic servant in the discharge of his official duties.   No\\none can take such proceedings without such sanction.  If the\\ngovernment  gives  sanction against one public  servant  but\\ndeclines  to  do  so against another,  then  the  government\\nservant   against  whom  sanction  is  given  may   possibly\\ncomplain,  of discrimination.  But the petitioners  who  are\\ncomplainants  cannot  be  heard to say so for  there  is  no\\ndiscrimination  as  against any complainant.  It has  to  be\\nborne in mind that a discretionary power is not  necessarily\\na discriminatory power and that abuse of power is not to  be\\neasily assumed where the discretion is vested in the govern-\\nment  and not in a minor official.  Further, we are not  now\\nconcerned  with  any such question.  We have merely  to  see\\nwhether the court could take cognisance of the case  without\\nprevious sanction and for this purpose the court has to find\\nout  if  the  act complained against was  committed  by  the\\naccused  while acting or purporting to act in the  discharge\\nof  official duty.  Once this is settled, the case  proceeds\\nor is thrown out.  Whether sanction is to be accorded or not\\nis  a matter for the government to consider.   The  absolute\\npower  to  accord  or withhold  sanction  conferred  on  the\\ngovernment is irrelevant and foreign to the duty cast on the\\ncourt, which is the ascertainment of the true nature of  the\\nact.\\nThe  objection based on entry into the wrong premises is  of\\nno  substance;  it  is  quite  probable  that  the   warrant\\nspecified  17  instead of P. 17 by a bona  fide  mistake  or\\nerror;  or it may be that the party made an honest  mistake.\\nAs  a matter of fact, the account books, etc. were found  in\\nP. 17, the premises raided.\\nSlightly differing tests have been laid down in the\\ndecided oases to ascertain the scope and the meaning of  the\\nrelevant  words occurring in section 197 of the  Code;  \\\"any\\noffence  alleged to have been committed by him while  acting\\nor purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty\\\".\\nBut the difference is only in language and not in substance.\\nThe  offence  alleged  to  have  been  committed  must  have\\nsomething to do, or must be related in some manner, with the\\ndischarge  of  official duty.  No question of  sanction  can\\narise under section 197, unless the act complained of is  an\\noffence;  the  only  point to determine is  whether  it  was\\ncommitted in the discharge of official duty.  There must  be\\na  reasonable connection\\u2019 between the act and  the  official\\nduty.   It does not matter even if the act exceeds  what  is\\nstrictly  necessary for the discharge of the duty,  as  this\\nquestion  will  arise only at a later stage when  the  trial\\nproceeds  on the merits.  What we must find out  is  whether\\nthe act and the official duty are so inter-related that  one\\ncan postulate reasonably that it was done by the accused  in\\nthe  performance  of the official duty, though  possibly  in\\nexcess  of the needs and requirements of the situation.   In\\nHori Ram Singh v. The Crown(1), Sulaiman, J. observes:\\n\\\"The  section  cannot be confined to only such acts  as  are\\ndone by a public servant directly in pursuance of his public\\noffice,  though  in excess of the duty or under  a  mistaken\\nbelief  as  to  the  existence of  such  duty.   Nor  is  it\\nnecessary  to  go  to  the length of  saying  that  the  act\\nconstituting the offence should be so inseparably  connected\\nwith  the  official duty as to form part and parcel  of  the\\nsame transaction\\\".\\nThe interpretation that found favour with Varadachariar,  J.\\nin  the  same case is stated by him in these terms  at  page\\ncomplained of that attaches it to the official character  of\\nthe person doing it\\\".  In affirming this view, the  Judicial\\nCommittee of the Privy Council observe in Gill\\u2019s case(1)  \\\"A\\npublic servant can only be said to act or purport to act  in\\nthe discharge of his official duty, if his act is such as to\\n(1) [1939] F.C.R. 159,178.\\n(2) [1948] L.R. 75 I.A. 41.\\nlie within the scope of his official duty .... The test  may\\nwell  be  whether  the public servant,  if  challenged,  can\\nreasonably  claim that, what he does, he does in  virtue  of\\nhis office\\\". Hori Ram\\u2019s case(1) is referred to with approval\\nin the later ease of Lieutenant Hector Thomas Huntley v. The\\nKing-Emperor(1)  but  the  test laid down that  it  must  be\\nestablished  that the act complained of was an official  act\\nappears  to  us  unduly  to narrow down  the  scope  of  the\\nprotection afforded by section 197 of the Criminal Procedure\\nCode  as  defined and understood in the earlier  case.   The\\ndecision  in  Meads  v. The King(1) does not  carry  us  any\\nfurther; it adopts the reasoning in Gill\\u2019s case(1).\\n There are two cases of this Court to which reference may be\\nmade  here.  In Shreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli v. The  State\\nof  Bombay(1),  Bose,  J. observes as follows:  \\\"Now  it  is\\nobvious  that  if  section  197  of  the  Code  of  Criminal\\nProcedure  is  construed  too  narrowly,  it  can  never  be\\napplied, for of course, it is no part of an official\\u2019s  duty\\nto  commit an offence and never can be.  But it is  not  the\\nduty  we  have  to examine so much as the  act,  because  an\\nofficial  act can be performed in the discharge of  official\\nduty  as  well  as in dereliction of it.   The  section  has\\ncontent  and  its  language must  be  given  meaning\\\".   The\\nquestion  of previous sanction also arose in Amrik Singh  v.\\nThe  State of PEPSU(6).  A fairly lengthy discussion of  the\\nauthorities  is followed up with this summary: \\\"If the  acts\\ncomplained  of are so integrally connected with  the  duties\\nattaching to the office as to be inseparable from them, then\\nsanction  under  section 197(1) would be necessary;  but  if\\nthere  was  no  necessary connection between  them  and  the\\nperformance of those duties, the official status  furnishing\\nonly  the  occasion  or opportunity for the  acts,  then  no\\nsanction would be required\\\".\\nThe  result of the foregoing discussion is this: There  must\\nbe a reasonable connection between the act and the discharge\\nof official duty; the act must bear such\\n(1)  [1939] F.C.R. 159,178,\\n(2)  [1944] F.C.R. 262.\\n(3)  [1948] L.R. 75 I.A. 185.\\n(4)  [1948] L.R. 75 I.A. 41.\\n(5)  [1955] 1 S.C.R 1177, 1186.\\n(6)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1302, 1307, 1308.\\nrelation   to  the  duty  that  the  accused  could  lay   a\\nreasonable,  but not a pretended or fanciful claim, that  he\\ndid it in the course of the performance of his duty.\\nIs  the  need for sanction to be considered as soon  as  the\\ncomplaint   is  lodged  and  on  the   allegations   therein\\ncontained?  At first sight, it seems as though there is some\\nsupport for this view in Hori Ram\\u2019s case and also in  Sarjoo\\nPrasad  v. The King-Emperor(1).  Sulaiman, J. says  that  as\\nthe  prohibition  is  against the  institution  itself,  its\\napplicability  must be judged in the first instance  at  the\\nearliest  stage  of  institution.   Varadachariar,  J.  also\\nstates  that the question must be determined with  reference\\nto  the  nature of the allegations made against  the  public\\nservant  in the criminal proceeding.  But a careful  perusal\\nof  the later parts of their judgments shows that  they  did\\nnot  intend to lay down any such proposition.  Sulaiman,  J.\\nrefers (at page 179) to the prosecution case as disclosed by\\nthe  complaint  or  the police report and he  winds  up  the\\ndiscussion  in these words: \\\"Of course, if the case  as  put\\nforward  fails  or  the defence  establishes  that  the  act\\npurported   to  be  done  is  in  execution  of  duty,   the\\nproceedings  will  have  to be  dropped  and  the  complaint\\ndismissed  on  that ground\\\".  The other learned  Judge  also\\nstates  at  page  185, \\\"At this stage we have  only  to  see\\nwhether the case alleged against the appellant or sought  to\\nbe proved against him relates to acts done or purporting  to\\nbe  done by him in the execution of his duty\\\".  It  must  be\\nso.  The question may arise at any stage of the proceedings.\\nThe complaint may not disclose that the act constituting the\\noffence was done or purported to be done in the discharge of\\nofficial  duty; but facts subsequently coming to light on  a\\npolice  or  judicial inquiry or even in the  course  of  the\\nprosecution  evidence  at  the  trial,  may  establish   the\\nnecessity  for sanction.  Whether sanction is  necessary  or\\nnot  may  have to be determined from stage  to  stage.   The\\nnecessity may reveal itself in the course of the progress of\\nthe case.\\nWe are not prepared to concede in favour of the\\n(1)  [1945] F.C.R. 227,\\nappellants   the  correctness  of  the  extreme   proportion\\nadvanced by Mr. Isaacs on their behalf that when obstruction\\nis  laid  or resistance offered against  an  authorised  and\\ntherefore  lawful  search, the officials  conducting  the  -\\nsearch  have no right to remove or cause to be  removed  the\\nobstruction  or resistance by the employment  of  reasonable\\nforce,  and their remedy is only to resort to the police  or\\nthe  magistracy  with  a  complaint.   Such  a  view   would\\nfrustrate the due discharge of the official duty and  defeat\\nthe very object of the search, as the books, etc.. might  be\\nsecreted  or  destroyed  in  the  interval;  and  it   would\\nencourage obstruction or resistance even to lawful acts.  It\\nmay be that more than reasonable force is used to clear  the\\nobstruction  or remove the resistance, but that would  be  a\\nfit  subject-matter for inquiry during the  proceedings;  it\\nwould not make the act of removal improper or unlawful.   It\\nis a matter for doubt if Chapters V and VII of the  Criminal\\nProcedure  Code can be read as an exhaustive enumeration  of\\nall  the powers of a search party.  Anyhow, section 6,  sub-\\nsection  (9) of the Investigation Commission Act  makes  the\\nprovisions  relating to searches applicable only \\\"go far  as\\nthey can be made applicable\\\".\\nThe  two English cases relied on are scarcely of  any  help.\\nIn Jones v. Owen\\\"), a rather startling view was taken that a\\npower to apprehend a person for a statutory offence did  not\\ninclude a power to move that person gently aside.  Hatton v.\\nTreeby(2)  was  a  case where the Act  of  Parliament  which\\ncreated a new offence did not in itself provide for a  power\\nof detention of the offender.\\nWhere  a power is conferred or a duty imposed by statute  or\\notherwise\\u2019  and there is nothing said  expressly  inhibiting\\nthe exercise of the power or the performance of the duty  by\\nany  limitations or restrictions, it is reasonable  to  hold\\nthat it carries with it the power of doing all such acts  or\\nemploying  such means as are reasonably necessary  for  such\\nexecution.   If  in  the  exercise  of  the  power  or   the\\nperformance\\n(1)  [1823] L.J.

This accords with commonsense and does not seem\\ncontrary  to  any principle -of law.  The true  position  is\\nneatly  stated  thus in Broom\\u2019s Legal Maxims, 10th  Ed.,  at\\npage  312: \\\"It is a rule that when the law commands a  thing\\nto be done, it authorises the performance of whatever may be\\nnecessary for executing its command\\\".\\nLet  us  however  assume that Mr. Isaacs  is  right  in  his\\ncontention.   Still, it can be urged that the accused  could\\nclaim  that  what  they did was in the  discharge  of  their\\nofficial duty.  The belief that they had a right to get  rid\\nof  the  obstruction  then and there  by  binding  down  the\\ncomplainants  or  removing  them from  the  place  might  be\\nmistaken,  but, surely, it could not be said that their  act\\nwas  necessarily  mala fide and entirely  divorced  from  or\\nunconnected  with the dig\\u2019 charge of their duty that it  was\\nan  independent act maliciously done or perpetrated.,  They.\\ncould  reasonably claim that what they did was in virtue  of\\ntheir  official duty, whether the claim is found  ultimately\\nto be well-founded or not.\\nReading  the  complaints  alone in  these  two  cases,  even\\nwithout the details of facts as narrated by the witnesses at\\nthe judicial inquiries, it is fairly clear that the  assault\\nand use of criminal force, etc. alleged against the  accused\\nare definitely related to the performance of their  official\\nduties.  But taken along with them, it seems to us to be  an\\nobvious  case  for  sanction.   The  injuries  a  couple  of\\nabrasions  and  a  swelling  on  Nandram  Agarwala  and  two\\necohymosis on Matajog--indicate nothing more than a  scuffle\\nwhich  is  likely  to  have ensued  when  there  were  angry\\nprotests  against  the  search and a pushing  aside  of  the\\nprotestors so that the search may go on unimpeded.\\nMr.  Isaacs  finally  pointed out that  the  fourth  accused\\nNageswar  Tewari  was a constable and the case  should  have\\nbeen allowed to proceed against him at least.  This question\\narises only in Nandram Agarwala\\u2019s case.  The Magistrate  who\\ndismissed the com-\\nplaint  took  the view that theme was no use  in  proceeding\\nagainst  him alone, as the main attack was directed  against\\nthe  Income-Tax  Officials.   No such  grievance  was  urged\\nbefore  the High Court and it is not raised in  the  grounds\\nfor special leave.\\nWe  hold that the orders of the High Court are  correct  and\\ndismiss these two appeals.\",\n          \"CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 14 of 1959.\\nAppeal  by special leave from the Award dated  February  21,\\nat Bombay, in Reference CGIT No. 12 of 1957.\\nSachin  Chaudhury,  S.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\\nWANCHOO,  J.-This  is  an  appeal by  special  leave  in  an\\nindustrial  matter.   The appellant is The  Chartered  Bank,\\nBombay  (hereinafter called the Bank).  There was a  dispute\\nbetween  the Bank and its workmen regarding the  termination\\nof  the  service, of one Colsavala (hereinafter  called  the\\nrespondent)  who was working as an assistant cashier in  the\\nBank.   The system of working in the cash department of  the\\nBank  is  that there is a chief cashier and  under  him  are\\nabout  thirty assistant cashiers.  The Chief Cashier has  to\\ngive   security  for  the  work  of  the  cash   department.\\nConsequently  all assistant cashiers are employed  upon  the\\nintroduction  of the Chief Cashier who guarantees each  such\\nemployee.   By  virtue of this guarantee the  Chief  Cashier\\nalone  is  unconditionally responsible to the Bank  for  any\\nshortage  which  might occur in the cash department  and  no\\nsecurity  is  taken  from  the  assistant  cashiers  working\\ntherein.   In  view of this guarantee by the  Chief  Cashier\\nthere  has been a longstanding practice in the Bank that  at\\nthe  end  of the day when the cash is locked  up  under  the\\nsupervision of the Chief Cashier, all the assistant cashiers\\nhave to be present so that the cash may be checked before\\nbeing  locked  up.  Assistant Cashiers  therefore  can  only\\nleave  the  Bank  before the locking up of  the  cash  after\\nobtaining permission of the Chief Cashier.\\nOn  January  4,  1957, the Chief  Cashier  reported  to  the\\nmanagement  that  the respondent had been leaving  the  Bank\\nwithout  his permission for some time past before  the  cash\\nwas  checked  and  locked  up in spite of  the  issue  of  a\\ndepartmental  circular in that behalf on December 24,  1956,\\nby  which all assistant cashiers (including the  respondent)\\nwere reminded of the longstanding practice that no assistant\\ncashier should leave the Bank without the permission of  the\\nChief  Cashier before the cash was checked and  locked  tip.\\nThe  Chief  Cashier therefore stated that he was  unable  to\\ncontinue  to  guarantee the respondent and that  unless  the\\nrespondent\\u2019s  service  was dispensed with his  conduct  will\\naffect  the  security of the cash department.  As  the  Bank\\nwas- not prepared to change the system in force in the  cash\\ndepartment,  the  management decided to  dispense  with  the\\nservice  of  the respondent in accordance with the  mode  of\\ntermination prescribed by paragraph 522(1) of the All  India\\nIndustrial  Tribunal  (Bank Disputes) Award of  March,  1953\\n(hereinafter  referred to as the Bank Award).  The Bank  was\\nalso   unable  to  employ  the  respondent  in   any   other\\ndepartment.   It therefore informed the respondent on  March\\nbeen  withdrawn by the Chief Cashier the Bank was unable  to\\ncontinue to employ him.  The notice required under paragraph\\nincluding retrenchment compensation was paid to him and  his\\nservice  was terminated.  Thereupon a dispute was raised  by\\nthe  workmen  of the Bank and a reference was  made  by  the\\nCentral  Government to the Industrial Tribunal with  respect\\nto the \\\"alleged wrongful termination of the services of Shri\\nN.  D.  Colsavala  by the Chartered Bank,  Bombay,  and  the\\nrelief, if any, to which he is entitled.\\\"\\nThe  case on behalf of the respondent was that he  had  been\\nworking  in the Bank since September 1, 1937,  honestly  and\\nefficiently  as an assistant cashier in the cash  department\\nThe previous Chief Cashier who\\nwas  the father of the present Chief Cashier however  became\\nhostile to him since 1943, because he claimed his legitimate\\ndues  for  overtime  work and leave  which  the  then  Chief\\nCashier was not prepared to allow.  Further the respondent\\u2019s\\nletter  of  appointment  did  not oblige  him  to  give  any\\nsecurity  or  to  procure any guarantee  and  if  the  Chief\\nCashier had given any guarantee to the Bank, the  respondent\\nwas  not concerned with it and had even no knowledge of  it.\\nHe  was given no opportunity to contest the reasons for  the\\nwithdrawal of the guarantee by the Chief Cashier; nor was he\\nasked  to furnish security or give a fidelity bond, even  if\\nthe   Chief  Cashier  had  withdrawn  the   guarantee.    In\\nconsequence the discharge of the respondent from service  on\\nthe ground given by the Bank was entirely illegal,  wrongful\\nand  unjustified and he was entitled to reinstatement or  in\\nthe alternative to full compensation for loss of employment.\\nThe  case of the Bank was that it was entitled to  terminate\\nthe service of the respondent under paragraph 522(1) of  the\\nBank  Award  and  it was not incumbent on it  to  state  the\\nreasons  for such termination and the reasons could  not  be\\ninquired   into  or  examined  by  the  tribunal.   In   the\\nalternative it was submitted that if the tribunal was of the\\nopinion that it was open to it to inquire into the  reasons,\\nthe Bank\\u2019s case was that the respondent was not dismissed or\\ndischarged by way of punishment for any misconduct and  that\\nthe  Bank  merely  terminated his  service  under  paragraph\\nwithdrawn  by  the Chief Cashier and it  was  impossible  to\\ncontinue to employ him in the circumstances, the Bank being.\\nunprepared to change its system of working which has already\\nbeen  mentioned above.  It was also said that the  Bank  was\\nnot  bound to transfer the respondent to another  department\\nand  in  any  case the  respondent\\u2019s  training,  experience,\\nability  or  record did not fit him for work  in  any  other\\ndepartment of the Bank.\\nThe  tribunal held that even though the Bank had  chosen  to\\nfollow  the procedure laid down in paragraph 522(1)  of  the\\nBank Award which provides for termination of employment  \\\"in\\ncases not involving\\ndisciplinary action for misconduct, by three months\\u2019  notice\\nor on payment of three months\\u2019 pay and allow. ances in  lieu\\nof notice\\\", this did not preclude it from inquiring into the\\nreasons for the termination of service and into the legality\\nand/or  propriety of the action taken by the bank  and  that\\nparagraph  522(1)  did not give a free hand to the  Bank  to\\ndispense  with the service of a permanent employee at  will.\\nIt  also  held that it was always open to  the  tribunal  to\\ninquire into the bona fides as well as justifiability of the\\naction taken.  It then went into the circumstances in  which\\nthe  termination  of service took place and was  of  opinion\\nthat  this was in fact and in reality a case of  termination\\nof  service for misconduct, and that it was the duty of  the\\nBank to follow the procedure for taking disciplinary  action\\nfor the alleged insubordination and persistent  disobedience\\nof  the orders of the Chief Cashier by the  respondent  with\\nrespect  to  leaving the Bank without his  prior  permission\\nbefore  the cash was checked and looked up and  inasmuch  as\\nthe  Bank  failed to follow the requisite procedure  as  was\\nlaid   down  in  paragraph  521  of  the  Bank  Award,   the\\ntermination of the service of the respondent was illegal and\\nimproper and he was entitled to reinstatement with full back\\nwages  and other benefits.  It is this order which is  being\\nchallenged before us by the Bank.\\nThe  main  contention on behalf the Bank is  that  the  view\\ntaken by the tribunal that in every case where there may  be\\nsome  misconduct  the  Bank is bound  to  take  disciplinary\\naction under paragraph 521 of the Bank Award makes paragraph\\ncontended  that  in the peculiar position obtaining  in  the\\ncash  department  of  the Bank  whereby  the  Chief  Cashier\\nguarantees all the assistant cashiers working under him, the\\nBank did not want to go into the squabble between the  Chief\\nCashier  and  the respondent and as the  Chief  Cashier  had\\nwithdrawn the guarantee of the respondent, the Bank  decided\\nwithout apportioning any blame between the Chief Cashier and\\nthe  respondent  to act under paragraph 522(1) of  the  Bank\\nAward.  It is urged that paragraph 522(1) of the Bank  Award\\nis\\nparticularly meant to meet situation,,; like this which  may\\narise in a banking concern.\\nThe first question that arises therefore is the scope of the\\npower of the Bank to act under paragraph 522(1) of the  Bank\\nAward, particularly in the peculiar situation prevailing  in\\nthe  cash department of the Bank.  The position in the  cash\\ndepartment of the banks was considered by the Bank Award  in\\nChapter  XXI with respect to giving of security.   In  para-\\ngraphs  417 and 418, the existing practice in various  banks\\nis  summarised and it takes one of three forms,  namely--(i)\\nevery member of the staff is to give security, (ii) the head\\ncashier  gives  a guarantee on behalf of  all  the  cashiers\\nworking  under  him, and (iii) where  the  treasurer  system\\nprevails, the treasurer enters into a contract with the bank\\nand  recommends  the employees for employment  in  the  cash\\ndepartment  and  guarantees  their  fidelity  and  they  are\\nthereupon appointed by the bank.  The tribunal was not right\\nin  saying that the system which was prevailing in the  Bank\\nwas peculiar to it and was not mentioned in the Bank  Award.\\nIt will be seen that the system in the Bank is of the second\\nkind  noticed  in  the Bank Award where  the  Chief  Cashier\\nguarantees  all  those  working  under  him.   It  is   also\\nmentioned in the Bank Award that the Chief Cashier generally\\ntakes  security deposits from persons working under him  but\\nthat  did not appear to be the invariable rule, and  in  the\\nBank  the Chief Cashier does not take any security from  his\\nsubordinates.  In such a system the Bank has to depend  upon\\nthe security given by the Chief Cashier and his guarantee of\\nthe employees working under him.  It is impossible to accept\\nthat  this way of working was not known to  the  respondent.\\nThe  Bank  has  produced the  respondent\\u2019s  application  for\\nemployment and it is significant that it is addressed to the\\nChief Cashier and not to the management of the Bank and this\\nbears  out the contention of the Bank that the  subordinates\\nin the cash department are employed on the recommendation of\\nthe  Chief Cashier who gives guarantee for them.   Nor  does\\nthe  Bank\\u2019s  contention  that no one employed  in  the  cash\\ndepartment  leaves  without  permission  till  the  cash  is\\nchecked and locked up appears\\nimprobable,  for  the  practice  seems  necessary  for   the\\nsecurity  of the cash department.  Therefore when  the  Bank\\nwas  faced with the report of the Chief Cashier  dated  4-1-\\ncase  what  action  should be taken  on  that  report.   Two\\ncourses  were open to it: it could have  taken  disciplinary\\naction  under  paragraph 521 of the Bank Award or  it  could\\nhave acted under paragraph 522(1).  The submission on behalf\\nof the Bank is that it did not want to go into the  squabble\\nbetween  the  Chief Cashier and the respondent  and  as  the\\nChief  Cashier had withdrawn his guarantee with  respect  to\\nthe  respondent  it  acted bona  fide  in  proceeding  under\\nparagraph  522(1) and thus no question arose of  its  taking\\ndisciplinary action against the respondent.\\nThere is no doubt that an employer cannot dispense with  the\\nservices  of a permanent employee by mere notice  and  claim\\nthat the industrial tribunal has no jurisdiction to  inquire\\ninto the circumstances in which such termination of  service\\nsimpliciter   took   place.   Many  standing   orders   have\\nprovisions  similar to paragraph 522(1) of the  Bank  Award,\\nand the scope of the power of the employer to act under such\\nprovisions  has  come  up for  consideration  before  labour\\ntribunals  many a time.  In Buckingham and Carnatic  Company\\nLtd., Etc., v. Workers of the Company, etc. (1), the  Labour\\nAppellate  Tribunal  had occasion to  consider  this  matter\\nrelating  to  discharge  by notice or  in  lieu  thereof  by\\npayment of wages for a certain period without assigning  any\\nreason.  It was of opinion that even in a case of this  kind\\nthe  requirement  of  bona fides is  essential  and  if  the\\ntermination of service is a colourable exercise of the power\\nor  as a result of victimisation or unfair  labour  practice\\nthe  industrial  tribunal  would have  the  jurisdiction  to\\nintervene  and set aside such termination.  Further it  held\\nthat  where  the  termination  of  services  is  capricious,\\narbitrary or unnecessarily harsh on the part of the employer\\njudged  by normal standards of a reasonable man that may  be\\ncogent evidence of victimisation or unfair labour  practice.\\nWe are of opinion that this correctly lays down the scope of\\nthe power of the tribunal to\\n(1)  [1952] L.A.C. 490.\\ninterfere where service is terminated simpliciter under  the\\nprovisions  of a contract or of standing orders or  of  some\\naward  like  the Bank Award.  In order to  judge  this,  the\\ntribunal  will have to go into all the  circumstances  which\\nled  to the termination simpliciter and an  employer  cannot\\nsay  that  it  is not bound to  disclose  the  circumstances\\nbefore  the tribunal.  The form of the order of  termination\\nis not conclusive of the true nature of the order, for it is\\npossible  that  the form may be merely a camouflage  for  an\\norder  of dismissal for misconduct.  It is therefore  always\\nopen  to the tribunal to go behind the form and look at  the\\nsubstance;  and if it comes to the conclusion, for  example,\\nthat  though  in  form  the  order  amounts  to  termination\\nsimpliciter it in reality cloaks a dismissal for  misconduct\\nit  will  be  open to it to set it  aside  as  a  colourable\\nexercise of the power.\\nIt  is on these principles therefore that we have  to  judge\\nthe action taken by the Bank in this case.  In the statement\\nof  claim put in by the workmen there was no  allegation  of\\nvictimisation  or unfair labour practice.  An affidavit  was\\nfiled  by the respondent later before the tribunal in  which\\nit  was said that the Bank had acted mala fide  in  removing\\nhim from service.  But in this affidavit nothing was said as\\nto how the management of the Bank as distinct from the Chief\\nCashier  had  any  reason  to  act  mala  fide  against  the\\nrespondent.  The tribunal also has not recorded any  finding\\nthat  the action of the Bank in terminating the  service  of\\nthe  respondent was mala fide or amounted to  unfair  labour\\npractice  or  was  a  case  of  victimisation.   It  ordered\\nreinstatement  on  the  ground that this was  a  case  where\\ndisciplinary action must and should have been taken and that\\nwas  not  done.  In one part of the award the  tribunal  has\\nremarked  that  if it is found that the Bank has  merely  in\\ncolourable  exercise  of  the power  made  the  order  under\\nparagraph  522(1) of the Bank Award, the order would not  be\\nsustainable.  But there is no finding that the action  taken\\nin  this case was a colourable exercise of the  power  under\\nparagraph  522(1).  It is, however, urged on behalf  of  the\\nrespondent that even though there is no such finding by  the\\ntribunal a perusal of the entire award seems\\nto show that this was what the tribunal thought inasmuch  as\\nit  has  said  that this was a case  in  which  disciplinary\\naction must and should have been taken.  However, as we read\\nthe  award  of the tribunal, the impression that we  get  is\\nthat  its view was that where there is an  allegation  which\\nmay amount to misconduct against an employee of a bank,  the\\nprocedure  under paragraph 521 must always be  followed  and\\nthat  the  procedure  under paragraph 522(1)  can  never  be\\nfollowed;  and  that is why the tribunal did  not  give  any\\nfinding  that  the  action  of the  Bank  was  a  colourable\\nexercise  of  the  power under  paragraph  522(1).   But  as\\nlearned counsel for the respondents has urged before us that\\nthe action in this case is in any case a colourable exercise\\nof the power under paragraph 522(1) we propose to look  into\\nthis aspect of the matter ourselves.\\nIt  is  true that there was some kind of allegation  by  the\\nChief  Cashier which may amount to misconduct in  this  case\\nand if we were satisfied that the termination of service  of\\nthe respondent was due to that misconduct and that the  form\\nof  the order was merely a cloak to avoid holding  a  proper\\nenquiry under paragraph 521, no doubt there would have  been\\nno  case  for interference with the order of  the  tribunal.\\nBut this is a peculiar case depending upon a peculiar system\\nprevalent  in the cash department of the Bank.  That  system\\nis  that  the Chief Cashier gives security  for  the  entire\\nworking  of  the  cash  department  and  is  unconditionally\\nresponsible  for  any loss that might be occasioned  to  the\\nBank   in  that  department.   The  appointments   in   that\\ndepartment  are  made  on the recommendation  of  the  Chief\\nCashier and he gives a guarantee about each employee and  is\\nunconditionally  responsible  to the Bank for  any  shortage\\nwhich  might occur.  It is in these circumstances  that  the\\nBank was faced with the report of the Chief Cashier by which\\nfor the reason given by him he withdrew the guarantee so far\\nas  the respondent was concerned.  The security of the  cash\\ndepartment  was thus involved and if the Bank decided as  it\\nseems  to have done in this case that it would not  go  into\\nthe  squabble between the Chief Cashier and  the  respondent\\nand would use paragraph 522(1) of the\\nBank  Award  to terminate the service of the  respondent  it\\ncannot be said that the Bank was exercising its power  under\\nparagraph  522(1)  in  a colourable  manner.   It  may  have\\nhonestly  come to the conclusion that in this situation,  as\\nit was not possible for it to change its system in the  cash\\ndepartment, there was no option for it but to dispense  with\\nthe service of the respondent under paragraph 522(1) of  the\\nBank  Award without going into the rights and wrongs of  the\\ndispute  between the Chief Cashier and the  respondent.   In\\nthe  peculiar circumstances therefore obtaining in the  cash\\ndepartment of the Bank it cannot in our opinion be said that\\nthe  use of the power under paragraph 522(1) by the Bank  in\\nthe  present case was a colourable exercise of  that  power.\\nNor  do  we think that the failure of the  Bank  to  provide\\nalternative employment for the respondent would lead to  any\\nsuch inference,, for the Bank may very well be right when it\\nsays  that it is a specialised institution  and  considering\\nthat  the respondent has been working in one department  for\\nthe  last  twenty  years he was not fit to  be  absorbed  in\\nanother  department.   In  the circumstances  of  this  case\\ntherefore  we are not prepared to hold that the  termination\\nof  the service of the respondent was a colourable  exercise\\nof the power under paragraph 522(1) of the Bank Award.   The\\nmention  of the fact that the service was  being  terminated\\nbecause the Chief Cashier had withdrawn the guarantee of the\\nrespondent  in the notice of. discharge will not change  the\\nnature  of  the  termination,  for  the  reason  was   given\\nobviously  to  avoid  the charge that  the  termination  was\\nentirely  capricious  or arbitrary, and therefore  not  bona\\nfide.\\nWe therefore allow the appeal and set aside the order of the\\ntribunal   by  which  the  respondent  was  ordered  to   be\\nreinstated with full back wages and other benefits.  In  the\\ncircumstances we pass no order as to costs.\\nAppeal allowed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":
